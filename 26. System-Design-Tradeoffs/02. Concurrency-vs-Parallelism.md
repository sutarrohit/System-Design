# Concurrency vs. Parallelism

Concurrency and parallelism are two of the most misunderstood concepts in system design. While they might sound similar, they refer to fundamentally different approaches to handling tasks.

-   **Concurrency**: Managing multiple tasks simultaneously by switching between them.
-   **Parallelism**: Executing multiple tasks at the same time on multiple CPU cores.

In this article, weâ€™ll break down the differences between these concepts, explore how they work, and illustrate their real-world applications with examples and code.

## 1. What is Concurrency?

**Concurrency** means an application is making progress on more than one task at the same time.

Since a **single CPU** can work on only one task at a time, it achieves concurrency by **rapidly switching between tasks**.

### Example:

-   Playing music **while** writing code.
-   The CPU alternates between these tasks so quickly that it **feels** like both are happening at the same time.

However, **this is not parallel execution**â€”this is concurrency.

---

### **How Does Concurrency Work?**

Concurrency is primarily achieved using **threads**, which are the smallest units of execution within a process. The CPU switches between threads to handle multiple tasks concurrently, ensuring the system remains responsive.

ðŸ›  **Process of Concurrency (Context Switching):**

1. **Context Saving**: The CPU saves the current task's state (e.g., program counter, registers) in memory.
2. **Context Loading**: The CPU loads the context of the next task.
3. **Rapid Switching**: The CPU repeats this process, making it appear as though tasks are running simultaneously.

ðŸ”´ **The Cost of Context Switching:**

-   Each switch requires saving and restoring states, **introducing overhead**.
-   Too many context switches can **degrade performance** by increasing CPU overhead.

## 2. Real-World Examples of Concurrency

### **1. Web Browsers**

Modern browsers perform multiple tasks concurrently:

-   Rendering web pages (**HTML/CSS**).
-   Fetching external resources (**images, scripts**).
-   Responding to **user actions** (clicks, scrolling).

Each of these tasks runs in **separate threads**, ensuring a smooth user experience.

---

### **2. Web Servers**

Web servers like **Apache or Nginx** handle multiple client requests **concurrently**:

-   Each request is processed independently using **threads** or **asynchronous I/O**.
-   Example: A server can handle multiple users loading different pages simultaneously **without blocking**.

---

### **3. Chat Applications**

A chat app needs to manage multiple operations at once:

-   Processing **incoming messages**.
-   Updating the **user interface** with new messages.
-   Sending **outgoing messages**.

This ensures **real-time communication** without delays.

---

### **4. Video Games**

Games rely on concurrency to **deliver an immersive experience**:

-   **Rendering graphics**.
-   **Processing user input** (e.g., character movement).
-   **Simulating physics**.
-   **Playing background audio**.

Example: While a player moves their character, the game simultaneously updates the **environment and plays music**, ensuring smooth gameplay.

## 3. Code Example: Concurrency in Javascript

```javascript
function task(name) {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        let count = 0;
        const interval = setInterval(() => {
            console.log(`Task ${name} is running`);
            count++;
            if (count === 5) {
                clearInterval(interval);
                resolve();
            }
        }, 1000);
    });
}

// Creating multiple concurrent tasks
const task1 = task("A");
const task2 = task("B");

// Running tasks concurrently
Promise.all([task1, task2]).then(() => {
    console.log("Both tasks completed!");
});
```

# 2. What is Parallelism?

Parallelism means multiple tasks are executed simultaneously.

To achieve parallelism, an application divides its tasks into smaller, independent subtasks. These subtasks are distributed across multiple CPUs, CPU cores, GPU cores, or similar processing units, allowing them to be processed in parallel.

## How Does Parallelism Work?

Modern CPUs consist of multiple cores. Each core can independently execute a task. Parallelism divides a problem into smaller parts and assigns each part to a separate core for simultaneous processing.

### Steps in Parallelism:

1. **Task Division**: The problem is broken into smaller independent sub-tasks.
2. **Task Assignment**: Sub-tasks are distributed across multiple CPU cores.
3. **Execution**: Each core processes its assigned task simultaneously.
4. **Result Aggregation**: Results from all cores are combined to form the final output.

## Real-World Examples of Parallelism

### 1. Machine Learning Training

Training deep learning models involves dividing datasets into smaller batches.  
Each batch is processed simultaneously across multiple GPUs or CPU cores, significantly speeding up the training process.

### 2. Video Rendering

Video frames are rendered independently, making it possible to process multiple frames simultaneously.  
For example, rendering a 3D animation becomes much faster when using multiple cores to handle different frames in parallel.

### 3. Web Crawlers

Web crawlers like Googlebot break a list of URLs into smaller chunks and process them in parallel.  
This allows the crawler to fetch data from multiple websites simultaneously, reducing the time to gather information.

### 4. Data Processing

Big data frameworks like Apache Spark leverage parallelism to handle massive datasets.  
Tasks such as analyzing logs from millions of users are distributed across a cluster, enabling simultaneous processing and faster insights.

### 5. Scientific Simulations

Simulations like weather modeling or molecular interactions require heavy computations.  
These computations are divided among multiple cores, allowing simultaneous execution and faster results.

### Code Example :

**Parallel Computation Using Worker Threads**

```javascript
const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort } = require("worker_threads");

if (isMainThread) {
    console.log("Main thread: Starting parallel tasks...");

    const worker1 = new Worker(__filename);
    const worker2 = new Worker(__filename);

    worker1.on("message", (msg) => console.log(`Worker 1: ${msg}`));
    worker2.on("message", (msg) => console.log(`Worker 2: ${msg}`));

    worker1.on("exit", () => console.log("Worker 1 finished"));
    worker2.on("exit", () => console.log("Worker 2 finished"));
} else {
    // Worker thread executing a CPU-intensive task
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < 1e9; i++) {
        sum += i;
    }
    parentPort.postMessage(`Sum: ${sum}`);
}
```

# 3. Concurrency and Parallelism Combinations

### 3.1 Concurrent, Not Parallel

An application can be concurrent without being parallel. In this case:

-   The application makes progress on multiple tasks at the same time seemingly (concurrently).
-   However, it achieves this by switching between tasks rapidly, rather than running them simultaneously.

**Example**: A single-core CPU alternating between tasks, giving the illusion of multitasking.

### 3.2 Parallel, Not Concurrent

An application can be parallel without being concurrent. Here:

-   A single task is divided into subtasks, and these subtasks are executed simultaneously on separate cores.
-   There is no overlap between tasks; one task (and its subtasks) completes before the next task starts.

**Example**: Video rendering, where a single video is divided into frames, and each frame is processed in parallel.

### 3.3 Neither Concurrent Nor Parallel

Some applications are neither concurrent nor parallel. This means:

-   Tasks are executed sequentially, one at a time, without any overlap or parallel execution.

**Example**: A single-core CPU where only one task is processed, and it completes fully before the next task begins.

### 3.4 Concurrent and Parallel

An application can be both concurrent and parallel, combining the strengths of both execution models.

In this approach:

-   Multiple tasks make progress at the same time, and each task is also divided into subtasks that are executed in parallel.

**Example**: A multi-core CPU where some subtasks run concurrently on the same core, while others run in parallel on separate cores.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa90047d9-3639-4de2-a8b1-6d8c90b85ad6_1015x683.png)

In the above example, a single task is broken into 4 subtasks, which are distributed across 2 CPU cores for parallel execution. These subtasks are executed by multiple threads. Some threads run on the same CPU core (concurrent execution), while others run on separate CPU cores (parallel execution).

If each subtask is executed by its own thread on a dedicated CPU (e.g., 4 threads on 4 CPUs), the task execution becomes fully parallel, with no concurrency involved.

Itâ€™s often challenging to break a task into exactly as many subtasks as there are CPUs. Instead, tasks are typically divided into a number of subtasks that align naturally with the problem's structure and number of CPU cores available.
