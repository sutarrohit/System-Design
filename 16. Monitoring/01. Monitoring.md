# 2. **Health Monitoring**

#### **1. Introduction to Health Monitoring**

Health monitoring is the process of continuously checking whether a system is operational and functioning as expected. It provides insights into the system's status, helping engineers detect failures, bottlenecks, and degraded performance before they impact users.

A system is considered **healthy** if:

-   It is running and available.
-   It can process incoming requests without errors.
-   All components (services, databases, caches, networks, etc.) are working as expected.

The main goals of health monitoring include:

#### **1. Introduction to Availability Monitoring**

Availability monitoring focuses on tracking whether a system and its components are accessible and operational over time. Unlike **health monitoring**, which provides an immediate snapshot of system health, availability monitoring measures the **historical uptime and reliability** of a system.

A highly available system should meet predefined **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)** and **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)**, such as:

-   **99.9% availability (three nines, ~8.76 hours of downtime per year)**
