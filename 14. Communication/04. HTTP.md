# **What is HTTP?**

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is a communication protocol used for exchanging data between a client (such as a web browser) and a server. It follows a **request-response model**, meaning that the client sends a request to a server, and the server responds with the requested data or an appropriate status code.

HTTP is a **stateless protocol**, meaning each request is independent and does not retain any information about previous interactions. This makes HTTP lightweight but also means additional mechanisms (such as cookies, sessions, or tokens) are needed for maintaining user state.

## **How HTTP Works**

HTTP operates over the **application layer** and relies on transport layer protocols like **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** or **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** to transmit data over the internet.

### **Basic Flow of an HTTP Request and Response:**

1. A client (e.g., a browser) sends an **HTTP request** to a server.
2. The server processes the request and sends back an **HTTP response**.
3. The client receives and processes the response, rendering content if necessary.

### **Example of an HTTP Request:**

```
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Accept: text/html
```

-   `GET` → The HTTP method used.
-   `/index.html` → The requested resource.
-   `HTTP/1.1` → The HTTP version.
-   `Host` → Specifies the target domain.
-   `User-Agent` → Identifies the client making the request.
-   `Accept` → Specifies the type of response the client expects.

### **Example of an HTTP Response:**

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 1024
Connection: keep-alive

<html>
   <body>
      <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
   </body>
</html>
```

-   `200 OK` → Status code indicating a successful request.
-   `Content-Type: text/html` → Specifies the type of data being returned.
-   `Content-Length: 1024` → The size of the response body.
-   `Connection: keep-alive` → Keeps the connection open for further requests.

## **HTTP Methods (Verbs)**

HTTP methods define the type of action to perform on a resource.

| **Method** | **Description**                        | **Idempotent** | **Safe** | **Cacheable**                |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------- | -------- | ---------------------------- |
| **GET**    | Retrieve data from a server            | ✅ Yes         | ✅ Yes   | ✅ Yes                       |
| **POST**   | Send data to a server (create/trigger) | ❌ No          | ❌ No    | ✅ If freshness info present |
| **PUT**    | Replace an existing resource           | ✅ Yes         | ❌ No    | ❌ No                        |
| **PATCH**  | Modify part of a resource              | ❌ No          | ❌ No    | ✅ If freshness info present |
| **DELETE** | Remove a resource                      | ✅ Yes         | ❌ No    | ❌ No                        |

### **Key Properties:**

-   **Idempotent**: If the same request is sent multiple times, the result will be the same.
-   **Safe**: The request does not modify resources.
-   **Cacheable**: The response can be stored for reuse.

## **HTTP Status Codes**

HTTP responses include status codes to indicate the outcome of a request.

| **Category** | **Range** | **Meaning**                                 |
| ------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **1xx**      | 100-199   | Informational responses                     |
| **2xx**      | 200-299   | Success responses                           |
| **3xx**      | 300-399   | Redirection responses                       |
| **4xx**      | 400-499   | Client errors (e.g., bad request)           |
| **5xx**      | 500-599   | Server errors (e.g., internal server error) |

### **Common Status Codes:**

-   **200 OK** → Request successful.
-   **201 Created** → Resource created successfully.
-   **204 No Content** → Request successful, but no data to return.
-   **301 Moved Permanently** → Resource has a new URL.
-   **302 Found (Temporary Redirect)** → Resource temporarily moved.
-   **400 Bad Request** → Invalid client request.
-   **401 Unauthorized** → Authentication required.
-   **403 Forbidden** → Client does not have permission.
-   **404 Not Found** → Requested resource does not exist.
-   **500 Internal Server Error** → Generic server-side issue.
-   **503 Service Unavailable** → Server is overloaded or down for maintenance.

## **HTTP Headers**

Headers provide metadata about the request or response.

### **Common Request Headers:**

-   `Host`: Specifies the server (e.g., `Host: www.example.com`).
-   `User-Agent`: Identifies the client (e.g., browser).
-   `Accept`: Specifies the expected content type.
-   `Authorization`: Contains authentication credentials (e.g., `Bearer Token` for API access).
-   `Cookie`: Sends session-related data.

### **Common Response Headers:**

-   `Content-Type`: Specifies the format of the response (e.g., `text/html`, `application/json`).
-   `Content-Length`: Specifies the response size in bytes.
-   `Set-Cookie`: Instructs the client to store a cookie.
-   `Cache-Control`: Defines caching rules.

## **HTTP vs HTTPS**

| Feature  | HTTP                 | HTTPS                                      |
| -------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Security | Not encrypted        | Encrypted with SSL/TLS                     |
| Protocol | Uses port 80         | Uses port 443                              |
| Use Case | General web browsing | Secure transactions (e.g., banking, login) |

HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) encrypts data using **SSL/TLS**, making it more secure than HTTP.

## **Key Features of HTTP**

-   **Stateless**: Each request is independent.
-   **Text-Based**: Messages are human-readable.
-   **Flexible**: Supports multiple data formats (HTML, JSON, XML, etc.).
-   **Cacheable**: Can store responses to improve performance.
-   **Extensible**: Can be modified using custom headers.

## **Conclusion**

HTTP is the backbone of the web, enabling seamless communication between clients and servers. Understanding HTTP methods, status codes, and headers is essential for web development and API communication.
