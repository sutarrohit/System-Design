# **Task Queues**

A **task queue** is a system that **receives, stores, and processes tasks asynchronously** in the background.

Instead of processing **long-running** or **high-computation tasks** immediately (which could slow down the main application), a **task queue offloads the work** and runs it **in the background** using **workers**.

### **Key Features of Task Queues**

✅ **Asynchronous execution** – Tasks are not executed immediately but queued for processing.  
✅ **Decoupling** – The main application **delegates work** to a task queue, avoiding slowdowns.  
✅ **Scalability** – Multiple workers can be added to process tasks in parallel.  
✅ **Scheduling support** – Tasks can be scheduled to run at specific times.  
✅ **Error handling & retries** – Failed tasks can be retried automatically.

## **Analogy: Restaurant Kitchen & Task Queue**

Imagine a restaurant where:

-   **Customers (requests)** place food orders (**tasks**).
-   The **waiter (task producer)** takes the order and **places it in a queue**.
-   The **kitchen (workers)** picks up the orders one by one and cooks them.
-   Once ready, the **waiter (task consumer)** delivers the food to the customer.

Here, the **order queue** prevents the kitchen from getting overwhelmed, ensuring **smooth processing** of each task.

## **How a Task Queue Works?**

A typical task queue system consists of **three main components**:

1️⃣ **Producer (Main App)** – Adds tasks to the queue.  
2️⃣ **Queue (Middleware, e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ, Kafka)** – Stores tasks until they are processed.  
3️⃣ **Worker (Consumer)** – Processes tasks in the background.

## **Example: Task Queue in Node.js using BullMQ (Redis-based Queue System)**

### **Scenario:**

We need to process **image uploads** asynchronously so that users don’t have to wait for the upload to complete.

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**

```sh
npm install bullmq ioredis express
```

---

### **Step 2: Create a Queue (Redis-based Task Queue)**

```javascript
const { Queue } = require("bullmq");
const redisConfig = { connection: { host: "localhost", port: 6379 } };

// Create a task queue
const imageQueue = new Queue("image-processing", redisConfig);

const addImageProcessingTask = async (imageId) => {
    await imageQueue.add("process-image", { imageId });
    console.log(`Task added: Processing image ${imageId}`);
};

module.exports = { addImageProcessingTask };
```

---

### **Step 3: Add API Endpoint for Task Submission**

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const { addImageProcessingTask } = require("./queue");

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post("/upload-image", async (req, res) => {
    const { imageId } = req.body;
    await addImageProcessingTask(imageId);
    res.status(202).json({ message: "Image processing started" });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server running on port 3000"));
```

-   The client **sends an image upload request**.
-   Instead of processing it immediately, the server **queues the task** and responds with `202 Accepted`.
-   The **worker will process it in the background**.

---

### **Step 4: Create a Worker to Process Tasks**

```javascript
const { Worker } = require("bullmq");
const redisConfig = { connection: { host: "localhost", port: 6379 } };

const imageWorker = new Worker(
    "image-processing",
    async (job) => {
        console.log(`Processing image: ${job.data.imageId}`);

        // Simulate image processing delay
        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 5000));

        console.log(`Image processed: ${job.data.imageId}`);
    },
    redisConfig
);

console.log("Worker started, waiting for tasks...");
```

-   The worker **listens to the queue** and **processes image uploads** asynchronously.
-   Even if the **server restarts**, queued tasks **won’t be lost** because they are stored in Redis.

---

## **Use Cases of Task Queues**

### ✅ **1. Background Processing**

-   Sending **emails** (e.g., order confirmation)
-   Generating **reports**
-   Running **batch jobs**

### ✅ **2. Delayed & Scheduled Tasks**

-   Sending **notifications** after 24 hours
-   Auto-deleting inactive user accounts

### ✅ **3. Load Distribution & Scalability**

-   Processing **thousands of image uploads**
-   Handling **large data imports**

---

## **Advantages of Task Queues**

🚀 **Improves Application Performance** – Main app responds quickly without waiting for slow tasks.  
🔄 **Ensures Reliability** – Tasks are retried if they fail (e.g., network issues).  
📈 **Scalability** – Add more workers to handle increasing load.  
⏳ **Efficient Scheduling** – Run tasks at specific times (cron jobs).

---

## **Conclusion**

✅ **Task queues help in handling asynchronous, long-running jobs efficiently.**  
✅ **Using Redis-based queues (like BullMQ) improves scalability and fault tolerance.**  
✅ **Background workers process tasks without blocking the main application.**
