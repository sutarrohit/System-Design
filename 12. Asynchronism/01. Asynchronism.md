# **Asynchronism**

Asynchronism refers to **executing tasks without blocking the main execution flow**. Instead of waiting for a task to complete before moving on to the next one, asynchronous workflows allow other tasks to **continue running** while waiting for the slower task to finish.

In **system design**, asynchronism is widely used to **reduce request times**, improve **scalability**, and optimize the performance of systems handling expensive operations.

## **Why Use Asynchronous Workflows?**

âœ… **Faster Response Times** â€“ Expensive operations (like database queries, API calls, or file processing) donâ€™t block execution.

âœ… **Better User Experience** â€“ Users donâ€™t have to wait for time-consuming tasks (e.g., video uploads, payment processing, or search indexing).

âœ… **Efficient Resource Utilization** â€“ Asynchronous systems can process multiple requests concurrently, avoiding bottlenecks.

âœ… **Precomputed Data** â€“ Time-consuming aggregations can be done **before** users need them (e.g., analytics reports, recommendation systems).

## **How Asynchronous Workflows Work**

1. **A request is received**

    - The system starts processing the request.

2. **The system delegates time-consuming work to an async process**

    - Instead of waiting for the task to complete, it **queues the task in a background worker or message queue**.

3. **The user gets a response immediately**

    - The system **returns a response quickly**, confirming that the task is being processed.

4. **The background worker processes the task asynchronously**

    - A worker or scheduled job picks up the task and processes it in the background.

5. **The system updates the client when the task is completed**
    - This could be done via **polling**, **webhooks**, or **real-time notifications (WebSockets, SSEs, Firebase, etc.)**.

## **Examples of Asynchronous Workflows in System Design**

### **1. Asynchronous Payment Processing (E-commerce Checkout)**

**Scenario:**

-   A user makes an online payment.
-   Instead of **waiting for payment confirmation** (which could take seconds or minutes), the system **processes it in the background** and notifies the user later.

**How It Works:**

1. The user submits payment details â†’ The system **queues the payment request**.
2. The system **immediately returns a confirmation message** ("Your payment is being processed").
3. A background worker processes the payment asynchronously.
4. The user is notified when the payment is completed (via **email, SMS, or app notification**).

ðŸ”¹ **Technologies Used:**

-   **Message Queues** (RabbitMQ, Kafka, SQS)
-   **Background Workers** (Celery, Sidekiq, Bull)
-   **Webhooks & Real-Time Notifications** (WebSockets, Firebase)

### **2. Asynchronous Data Aggregation (Analytics & Reporting Systems)**

**Scenario:**

-   A **dashboard displays user analytics (e.g., total sales, active users, engagement metrics)**.
-   Instead of querying the **entire database on every request** (which is slow), the system **precomputes and caches analytics data periodically**.

**How It Works:**

1. The system schedules a **background job to aggregate data** (e.g., every hour).
2. The aggregated results are **stored in a cache or database**.
3. When a user requests the analytics dashboard, the system **fetches precomputed data** instead of performing expensive database queries.

ðŸ”¹ **Technologies Used:**

-   **Batch Processing Frameworks** (Apache Spark, Hadoop)
-   **Scheduled Jobs** (Celery, Airflow, Kubernetes CronJobs)
-   **Caching Systems** (Redis, Memcached)

### **3. Asynchronous Video Processing (YouTube, Instagram, TikTok)**

**Scenario:**

-   A user uploads a video to YouTube.
-   The video **needs to be processed (compressed, converted, analyzed)** before it is available for streaming.

**How It Works:**

1. The user uploads a video.
2. The system **queues the video processing task** and returns a success message ("Your video is being processed").
3. A background worker **processes the video asynchronously** (compression, format conversion, metadata extraction).
4. Once processing is complete, the system **notifies the user that the video is ready**.

ðŸ”¹ **Technologies Used:**

-   **Message Queues** (Kafka, RabbitMQ, AWS SQS)
-   **Video Processing Services** (FFmpeg, AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Video API)
-   **Notifications** (WebSockets, Firebase, Email, SMS)

---

## **Common Patterns for Asynchronous Workflows**

### âœ… **1. Message Queues (MQ)**

-   Used for **decoupling services** and processing background tasks asynchronously.
-   Popular tools: **RabbitMQ, Kafka, AWS SQS, Google Pub/Sub**

ðŸ”¹ **Example (Node.js + BullMQ with Redis for queueing jobs)**

```javascript
const Queue = require("bull");
const videoQueue = new Queue("video processing", { redis: { host: "localhost", port: 6379 } });

// Add video processing job to queue
videoQueue.add({ videoId: 123, format: "mp4" });

// Worker to process video asynchronously
videoQueue.process(async (job) => {
    console.log(`Processing video ${job.data.videoId}`);
    // Simulate video processing (FFmpeg, cloud transcoding, etc.)
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 5000));
    console.log(`Video ${job.data.videoId} processed successfully`);
});
```

### âœ… **2. Event-Driven Architecture**

-   Services communicate using **events instead of direct API calls**.
-   Example: **Microservices emitting events to notify other services**.
-   Tools: **Apache Kafka, AWS EventBridge, Google Pub/Sub**

ðŸ”¹ **Example: User Signup Event (Microservices Architecture)**

1. **User Service emits a "UserSignedUp" event.**
2. **Email Service listens for this event** and sends a welcome email.
3. **Analytics Service listens for this event** and updates metrics.

```json
{
    "event": "UserSignedUp",
    "userId": 101,
    "timestamp": "2025-03-04T12:00:00Z"
}
```

---

### âœ… **3. Background Jobs & Workers**

-   Used for **offloading heavy tasks from the main request-response cycle**.
-   Examples: **Celery (Python), Sidekiq (Ruby), BullMQ (Node.js), Resque**

ðŸ”¹ **Example: Sending Asynchronous Emails using Celery (Python)**

```python
from celery import Celery

app = Celery('tasks', broker='redis://localhost:6379/0')

@app.task
def send_email(user_id):
    print(f"Sending email to user {user_id}")
    # Simulate email sending delay
    import time
    time.sleep(5)
    print("Email sent!")
```

-   **Step 1:** User submits a request to send an email.
-   **Step 2:** The email-sending task is **queued in Celery**.
-   **Step 3:** The user gets a response **immediately** ("Your email is being sent").
-   **Step 4:** Celery processes the email in the background.

## **Final Thoughts**

âœ… **Asynchronous workflows improve performance, scalability, and responsiveness.**  
âœ… They allow applications to **handle expensive operations without blocking requests**.  
âœ… **Message queues, background workers, and event-driven architectures** help implement async workflows effectively.
