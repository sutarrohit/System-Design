# **Event-Driven Architecture**

Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a **software design pattern** where the **flow of execution is driven by events** instead of sequential processing. These events can be **user actions, system-generated triggers, or data changes**.

### **Why Event-Driven?**

✅ **Decoupling** – Components are loosely coupled, allowing independent scalability.  
✅ **Asynchronous Processing** – Improves responsiveness and system performance.  
✅ **Real-time Reactions** – Systems respond instantly to changes (e.g., stock price updates).  
✅ **Scalability** – Can handle high loads by distributing events across multiple workers.

📌 **Examples of Event-Driven Systems:**

-   **E-commerce Checkout** – When a user places an order, an "Order Placed" event triggers background jobs for payment processing and inventory updates.
-   **Social Media Notifications** – A "New Comment" event triggers a notification to the post owner.
-   **IoT Devices** – A temperature sensor detects a change and triggers an alert.

## **Core Components of Event-Driven Systems**

Event-driven systems **listen** for events and **respond** by triggering appropriate tasks. These systems consist of:

### **1️⃣ Event Producers**

Producers **generate events** when an action occurs (e.g., user clicks a button, a file is uploaded).  
🔹 **Examples:**

-   A user **places an order** → "Order Placed" event is created.
-   A **new file is uploaded** → "File Uploaded" event is triggered.
-   A **sensor detects temperature change** → "Temperature Changed" event is sent.

### **2️⃣ Event Brokers (Message Queues)**

The **event broker** acts as a **middleman**, allowing event producers and consumers to communicate asynchronously.  
🔹 **Examples:**

-   **Kafka** – A distributed event streaming platform.
-   **RabbitMQ** – A message broker for event-based communication.
-   **AWS SQS (Simple Queue Service)** – Managed event queueing service.

### **3️⃣ Event Consumers (Subscribers)**

Consumers **listen for events** and perform background jobs when an event occurs.  
🔹 **Examples:**

-   "Order Placed" event → **Triggers Payment Processing.**
-   "File Uploaded" event → **Triggers Image Resizing.**
-   "Temperature Changed" event → **Triggers Alert Notification.**

## **Types of Event-Driven Triggers**

Background tasks can be **triggered** by different types of events.

### **1️⃣ Message Queue Trigger (Asynchronous Message-Based Communication)**

🔹 **How It Works:**

-   A **message queue** stores events.
-   Background jobs **listen** for new messages.
-   When a message arrives, the job **processes the event**.

📌 **Example – Order Processing in E-commerce:**

1. **User places an order** → "Order Placed" event is **published to a queue** (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).
2. **Order service listens** for events in the queue.
3. **Order service processes payment & updates inventory.**

✅ **Benefits:**

-   **Asynchronous** – Orders are processed without making the user wait.
-   **Scalable** – Multiple workers can process orders in parallel.

### **2️⃣ Database Trigger (Storage-Based Event Detection)**

🔹 **How It Works:**

-   A **database change (insert/update/delete)** acts as a trigger.
-   A background job **monitors the database** for changes.
-   When a change occurs, the job **processes the event**.

📌 **Example – Stock Price Updates:**

1. A **stock price update** is saved in a database.
2. A **background job detects the update**.
3. The job **notifies users about stock price changes**.

✅ **Benefits:**

-   **Real-time processing** – Jobs react instantly to database changes.
-   **Reliable** – Ensures **event persistence** (events are stored in the database).

---

### **3️⃣ API Trigger (Webhooks & HTTP Requests)**

🔹 **How It Works:**

-   An API **receives an event** (e.g., a webhook notification).
-   The API triggers a **background job**.
-   The job processes the event **asynchronously**.

📌 **Example – Payment Processing in Subscription Services:**

1. A user **makes a payment**.
2. The **payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)** sends a **webhook request** to the API.
3. The API **triggers a background job** to process the payment.
4. The job **updates the user’s subscription status**.

✅ **Benefits:**

-   **Instant updates** – External systems (e.g., Stripe) notify the app automatically.
-   **Decoupled communication** – The main app doesn’t need to wait for the payment to process.

## **Comparison of Event-Driven Triggers**

| **Trigger Type**     | **How It Works**                                           | **Example Use Case**                         | **Pros**                             | **Cons**                                     |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Message Queue**    | Events are stored in a queue and processed asynchronously. | Order processing, email notifications        | Scalable, reliable, async processing | Extra infrastructure needed (RabbitMQ/Kafka) |
| **Database Trigger** | Changes in the database trigger background jobs.           | Stock price updates, real-time analytics     | Real-time updates, event persistence | Increased DB load                            |
| **API/Webhook**      | External services send event notifications via HTTP.       | Payment processing, third-party integrations | Decoupled, event-driven automation   | Dependent on external services               |

## **Conclusion**

Event-driven architecture **improves scalability, responsiveness, and efficiency** in distributed systems. It enables **asynchronous processing** and **decoupled services**, making it ideal for **real-time applications, microservices, and large-scale distributed systems**.
