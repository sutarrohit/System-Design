# **CAP Theorem**

The **CAP theorem**, formulated by **Eric Brewer** in 2000, states that a distributed system can provide only **two** out of the following three guarantees at the same time:

1. **Consistency (C)** → Every read receives the latest write or an error.
2. **Availability (A)** → Every request gets a response, even if some nodes fail.
3. **Partition Tolerance (P)** → The system continues to function even if communication between nodes is lost.

> **Key Takeaway:**  
> **You can’t achieve all three (C, A, P) at the same time in a distributed system. You must choose two.**

## **2. Understanding the Three Guarantees**

### **1️⃣ Consistency (C)**

-   Every read returns the latest write or an error.
-   All nodes in the system see the same data at the same time.
-   If a write happens on one node, all future reads should reflect that update immediately.

> **Example:**
>
> -   In a **banking system**, if ₹10,000 is transferred from Account A to Account B, both accounts should reflect the transaction immediately.
> -   If one server shows the updated balance while another does not, **consistency is broken**.

🔹 **How to Achieve It?**

-   Use **synchronous replication**: The write is confirmed only after updating all nodes.
-   Example: **Relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL) use strong consistency**.

🔹 **Trade-offs:**

-   May lead to slower performance because all nodes must update before responding.
-   Difficult to maintain in large-scale distributed systems.

---

### **2️⃣ Availability (A)**

-   Every request receives a response, **even if some nodes fail**.
-   The response **may be outdated** (not the latest data).
-   No guarantee of **data consistency** across nodes at any given time.

> **Example:**
>
> -   When you search for a product on Amazon, you always get a response—even if one database node is down.
> -   The search results might be slightly outdated, but **availability is maintained**.

🔹 **How to Achieve It?**

-   Use **replication with eventual consistency**: The system responds immediately and synchronizes data in the background.
-   Example: **NoSQL databases like Cassandra, DynamoDB prioritize availability**.

🔹 **Trade-offs:**

-   Users might see stale (old) data.
-   Conflicts might arise if multiple versions of data exist.

---

### **3️⃣ Partition Tolerance (P)**

-   The system continues to function **even if network failures occur**.
-   If some nodes lose connection, the system should still process requests.
-   Partition tolerance is **a must** in any distributed system.

> **Example:**
>
> -   If a network partition occurs between two data centers, both should still operate independently.
> -   Cloud services like AWS **must handle network failures gracefully**.

🔹 **How to Achieve It?**

-   Distribute data across multiple nodes and ensure failover mechanisms.
-   Example: **DynamoDB, Kafka, and Google Spanner are partition-tolerant**.

🔹 **Trade-offs:**

-   May require sacrificing either **consistency (C) or availability (A)**.

## **3. CAP Theorem Trade-offs (Choosing Two Out of Three)**

| **Type**                                    | **Consistency (C)** | **Availability (A)** | **Partition Tolerance (P)**               | **Examples**                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)**  | ✅ Yes              | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes                                    | **PostgreSQL (with replication), MongoDB (strong consistency mode)** |
| **AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance)** | ❌ No               | ✅ Yes               | ✅ Yes                                    | **DynamoDB, Cassandra, DNS, CDN services**                           |
| **CA (Consistency + Availability)**         | ✅ Yes              | ✅ Yes               | ❌ No (Impossible in distributed systems) | **Not possible in real-world distributed systems**                   |

### **1️⃣ CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)**

-   Prioritizes **consistency** over availability.
-   If a partition (network failure) occurs, some requests may **fail** to ensure data correctness.

> **Example:**
>
> -   **MongoDB (strong consistency mode)**
> -   **Google Spanner** (synchronizes data using TrueTime API).

🔹 **Use Case:**

-   When **accuracy is more important than availability**, e.g., **banking systems, stock trading platforms**.

---

### **2️⃣ AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance)**

-   Prioritizes **availability** over consistency.
-   System always responds, but the data **might be outdated** for some time.

> **Example:**
>
> -   **Amazon DynamoDB, Apache Cassandra** → prioritize availability over strong consistency.
> -   **DNS systems** → ensure queries are always answered, even if records are stale.

🔹 **Use Case:**

-   When **high availability is critical**, e.g., **social media feeds, real-time analytics**.

---

### **3️⃣ CA (Consistency + Availability)**

-   This combination **cannot** exist in distributed systems.
-   If the system is consistent and always available, it **cannot tolerate network partitions**.
-   Works only in **single-node** databases (not distributed).

> **Example:**
>
> -   **Traditional single-node databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle DB)**.

🔹 **Why is it impossible in distributed systems?**

-   In real-world distributed systems, **network failures** (partitions) **will happen**.
-   Since the system must remain **partition-tolerant**, it must pick between **C or A**.

## **4. CAP Theorem in Real-World Databases**

| **Database**                          | **Type (CAP Category)**             | **Why?**                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **PostgreSQL (single node)**          | **CA (Not distributed)**            | Provides consistency and availability but no partition tolerance.                    |
| **MongoDB (strong consistency mode)** | **CP**                              | Ensures consistency but may reject requests when a partition occurs.                 |
| **Cassandra**                         | **AP**                              | Prioritizes availability and partition tolerance but allows temporary inconsistency. |
| **Amazon DynamoDB**                   | **AP (default), CP (configurable)** | Defaults to availability but can be configured for stronger consistency.             |

## **5. How to Choose the Right CAP Trade-off?**

| **Use Case**                        | **Best CAP Trade-off**                      | **Example Systems**                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Banking, Financial Transactions** | **CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)**  | Google Spanner, MongoDB (strong consistency mode) |
| **E-commerce (Shopping Carts)**     | **AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance)** | DynamoDB, Cassandra                               |
| **Stock Market, Trading Systems**   | **CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)**  | PostgreSQL with replication                       |
| **Social Media Feeds, Analytics**   | **AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance)** | Apache Kafka, DynamoDB                            |
| **Single-node Applications**        | **CA (Not distributed)**                    | MySQL, PostgreSQL (single-node)                   |

---

## **6. Conclusion**

-   The **CAP Theorem** states that **you can choose only two out of Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance**.
-   In **distributed systems**, partition tolerance (P) **is a must**, so you can only choose between **CP or AP**.
-   **CP Systems** (Strong Consistency) are used in banking, trading, and finance.
-   **AP Systems** (High Availability) are used in social media, analytics, and real-time systems.
