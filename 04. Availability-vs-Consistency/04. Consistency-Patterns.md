# **Consistency Patterns in Distributed Systems**

In distributed systems, **consistency** refers to how data updates are propagated across multiple nodes. Since maintaining strong consistency across all nodes is difficult (due to network latency and partitioning issues), different **consistency patterns** exist to balance trade-offs between performance, availability, and correctness.

## **Types of Consistency Patterns**

1. **Strong Consistency**
2. **Weak Consistency**
3. **Eventual Consistency**

Each of these patterns has its own characteristics, use cases, and trade-offs.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Strong Consistency**

### **Definition**

-   In **strong consistency**, all nodes in the system always return the latest data.
-   Every read operation retrieves the **most recent write**, ensuring that all users see the same data at the same time.

### **How It Works**

-   When data is updated on one node, the system ensures that **all other nodes are immediately updated before allowing any read operation**.
-   This requires **synchronous replication**, where writes must be acknowledged by all nodes before being considered successful.

### **Example**

> Suppose a user transfers ‚Çπ10,000 from their savings to their checking account. **Strong consistency guarantees that all nodes immediately reflect the updated balance** before allowing further transactions.

### **Implementation Techniques**

1. **Single Leader Replication (Primary-Replica Model)**

    - A single leader handles writes, and all replicas must update before responding to reads.
    - Example: **Google Spanner, CockroachDB**.

2. **Quorum-Based Systems**
    - Uses **Quorum Consensus**, where a majority of nodes must confirm a write before it is committed.
    - Example: **Paxos and Raft algorithms used in distributed databases**.

### **Trade-offs**

‚úÖ **Pros:**  
‚úî Guarantees the latest, accurate data.  
‚úî Prevents stale reads.  
‚úî Ensures **data correctness**, critical for financial systems.

‚ùå **Cons:**  
‚úñ **High latency** (because every write must be confirmed by multiple nodes).  
‚úñ **Reduced availability** (if a node goes down, the system may reject reads/writes).  
‚úñ **Expensive to scale** due to coordination overhead.

### **Use Cases**

-   **Banking and Financial Systems** (where accuracy is critical).
-   **Stock Trading Platforms** (where every update must be seen instantly).
-   **Cloud Databases with Global Consistency (Google Spanner, Azure Cosmos DB)**.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Weak Consistency**

### **Definition**

-   In **weak consistency**, data updates do not have to be immediately reflected across all nodes.
-   A read request may return **stale (outdated) data**.
-   The system **prioritizes availability over consistency**.

### **How It Works**

-   Writes are applied asynchronously.
-   Reads may return **old values** if updates have not reached all nodes.
-   Useful when **real-time accuracy is not required**, but **high availability is important**.

### **Example**

> Imagine a social media platform where users post updates. Some users might see a new post immediately, while others might see it after a short delay.

### **Implementation Techniques**

1. **Asynchronous Replication**

    - Updates are sent to replicas **in the background**, allowing reads before all replicas are updated.
    - Example: **Facebook Timeline, Twitter Feed**.

2. **Cache-Based Systems**
    - Uses **eventual consistency** with caching for performance.
    - Example: **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), DNS systems**.

### **Trade-offs**

‚úÖ **Pros:**  
‚úî **Faster performance** (no waiting for all nodes to sync).  
‚úî **High availability** (no downtime if nodes fail).  
‚úî Scalable for large distributed systems.

‚ùå **Cons:**  
‚úñ **Users may see stale (outdated) data**.  
‚úñ **No guarantees on when updates will be seen**.  
‚úñ **Not suitable for financial or critical systems**.

### **Use Cases**

-   **Social Media Feeds (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram)**.
-   **Caching Systems (CDNs, DNS, Redis, Memcached)**.
-   **Real-time analytics (Elasticsearch, ClickHouse)**.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Eventual Consistency**

### **Definition**

-   A relaxed form of **weak consistency** where updates eventually propagate to all nodes **but without a fixed guarantee on when**.
-   If no further updates occur, all nodes will **eventually** converge to the same state.

### **How It Works**

-   Updates are asynchronously propagated across nodes **without blocking reads**.
-   Some nodes may return stale data, but **given enough time, all nodes will sync**.
-   Commonly used in distributed NoSQL databases.

### **Example**

> Imagine an online shopping website with a **shopping cart system**.
>
> -   If a user adds an item, the update might take **a few seconds to reach all nodes**.
> -   If another request is made too soon, it might show an **older version** of the cart.
> -   However, **given some time, all nodes will eventually reflect the updated cart**.

### **Implementation Techniques**

1. **Gossip Protocols**

    - Nodes exchange information periodically to sync updates.
    - Example: **Amazon DynamoDB, Apache Cassandra**.

2. **Vector Clocks & Conflict Resolution**
    - Used in NoSQL databases to track changes and resolve conflicts.
    - Example: **CouchDB, Riak**.

### **Trade-offs**

‚úÖ **Pros:**  
‚úî **High availability and low latency**.  
‚úî **Efficient for large-scale distributed applications**.  
‚úî **Fault tolerant**, as nodes can sync even after failures.

‚ùå **Cons:**  
‚úñ **No guarantee of immediate consistency**.  
‚úñ **Requires conflict resolution mechanisms**.  
‚úñ **May lead to temporary inconsistencies**.

### **Use Cases**

-   **E-commerce systems (Amazon Shopping Cart)**.
-   **NoSQL databases (Cassandra, DynamoDB, CouchDB, Riak)**.
-   **Microservices architectures where high availability is required**.
