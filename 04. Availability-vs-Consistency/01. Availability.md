# **Availability**

Availability refers to the ability of a system to be operational and accessible when needed. It is a key metric in system design, ensuring that users can access services without unexpected downtime.

> **Formula for Availability:**  
> \[
> \text{Availability} = \frac{\text{Uptime}}{\text{Uptime} + \text{Downtime}}
> \]
> It is usually expressed as a **percentage (% uptime)**.

For example, if a system is available **99.99% of the time**, it means the system is down for:

-   **52.56 minutes per year**
-   **4.38 minutes per month**

---

## **2. Importance of Availability**

-   Ensures business continuity.
-   Improves user experience and trust.
-   Reduces revenue loss due to downtime.
-   Critical for financial, healthcare, and cloud systems.

## **3. Availability vs. Reliability**

| **Metric**       | **Definition**                                                 |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Availability** | The percentage of time a system is up and running.             |
| **Reliability**  | The ability of a system to perform correctly without failures. |

-   **Example:** A system might be **reliable** but **not highly available** if it fails rarely but takes a long time to recover.
-   A **highly available** system minimizes downtime even if failures occur.

## **4. Measuring Availability**

Availability is typically measured using **nines (9s) notation**:

| **Availability (%)**       | **Downtime per year** | **Downtime per month** |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **99% ("two nines")**      | **87.6 hours**        | **7.2 hours**          |
| **99.9% ("three nines")**  | **8.76 hours**        | **43.8 minutes**       |
| **99.99% ("four nines")**  | **52.56 minutes**     | **4.38 minutes**       |
| **99.999% ("five nines")** | **5.26 minutes**      | **26.3 seconds**       |

Mission-critical systems (e.g., **air traffic control, banking**) often aim for **"five nines" (99.999%)** availability.

## **9. Conclusion**

Availability is a critical aspect of system design, ensuring minimal downtime and a seamless user experience. By implementing redundancy, failover strategies, and monitoring, systems can achieve high availability.

# **Availability Patterns in Distributed Systems**

Availability refers to the ability of a system to remain operational and accessible to users **without unexpected downtime**. It is crucial for designing **highly reliable** and **fault-tolerant** systems.

## **Availability in Numbers**

Availability is usually expressed as a **percentage of uptime** and is commonly measured using the **"number of 9s" (nines)**. More **nines** mean higher availability and lower downtime.

| **Availability Level** | **Common Name** | **Downtime per Year** | **Downtime per Month** | **Downtime per Day** |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| **90.0%**              | One 9           | **36.5 days**         | **72 hours**           | **2.4 hours**        |
| **99.0%**              | Two 9s          | **3.65 days**         | **7.2 hours**          | **14.4 minutes**     |
| **99.9%**              | Three 9s        | **8h 41m 38s**        | **43m 28s**            | **1m 26s**           |
| **99.99%**             | Four 9s         | **52m 9.8s**          | **4m 21s**             | **8.6s**             |
| **99.999%**            | Five 9s         | **5m 15s**            | **26.3s**              | **864ms**            |

-   **99.9% ("Three 9s")**: Common for **web services**. Some minor downtime is acceptable.
-   **99.99% ("Four 9s")**: Used for **enterprise systems** where uptime is critical.
-   **99.999% ("Five 9s")**: Used in **mission-critical systems** (e.g., payment processing, telecom networks).

üìå **Key Takeaway:** **Even small increases in availability require significant engineering effort.**

## **Availability in Parallel vs. In Sequence**

A distributed system is often composed of **multiple components** (e.g., databases, application servers, caches, load balancers). The availability of the overall system depends on how these components are connected.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Availability in Sequence (Serial Dependency)**

-   If multiple components depend on each other **sequentially**, the overall availability **decreases**.
-   If **one component fails, the entire system fails**.
-   The total availability is the **product** of individual availabilities.

#### **Formula:**

\[
Availability*{Total} = Availability*{A} \times Availability\_{B}
\]

#### **Example:**

-   **Component A** has **99.9%** availability.
-   **Component B** has **99.9%** availability.
-   **Total availability:**  
    \[
    0.999 \times 0.999 = 0.998 = 99.8\%
    \]
-   This means an **extra 17.3 minutes of downtime per month** compared to a single component with 99.9% availability.

üìå **Key Takeaway:** **Avoid unnecessary dependencies between services in a sequential chain.**

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Availability in Parallel (Redundancy and Failover)**

-   If multiple components work **in parallel**, the system can survive failures.
-   Even if **one component fails, another takes over**, improving availability.
-   The total availability is calculated using the **complementary probability**.

#### **Formula:**

\[
Availability\_{Total} = 1 - (1 - Availability_A) \times (1 - Availability_B)
\]

#### **Example:**

-   **Component A** has **99.9%** availability.
-   **Component B** has **99.9%** availability.
-   **Total availability:**  
    \[
    1 - (1 - 0.999) \times (1 - 0.999) = 1 - 0.000001 = 99.9999\%
    \]

‚úÖ **Parallel redundancy improves availability significantly!**

-   **A system with two 99.9% components in parallel has an availability of 99.9999%.**
-   This reduces **downtime to just 32 seconds per year!**

üìå **Key Takeaway:** **Use redundancy (replication, failover mechanisms) to improve availability.**

---

## **High-Availability (HA) Strategies**

To **achieve high availability**, systems use several engineering patterns:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Load Balancing**

-   Distributes traffic across **multiple servers** to prevent overloading.
-   Example: **NGINX, AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Replication (Data Redundancy)**

-   Keeps multiple **copies of data** across different servers/data centers.
-   Example: **Primary-Replica databases, NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Cassandra)**.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Failover Mechanisms**

-   If one server fails, another takes over **automatically**.
-   Example: **Database failover in PostgreSQL, Redis Sentinel**.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Disaster Recovery & Backups**

-   Regular backups and replication across **geo-distributed** locations.
-   Example: **AWS Multi-AZ RDS, Google Spanner**.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Auto-scaling & Self-healing Systems**

-   Cloud platforms automatically **replace failed instances**.
-   Example: **Kubernetes auto-scaling, AWS Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)**.

## **Final Thoughts**

-   Availability is measured in **"nines"**, with more **nines meaning less downtime**.
-   **Sequential components** decrease availability, while **parallel components** improve it.
-   **Redundancy, replication, failover, and load balancing** help improve **high availability** (HA).
