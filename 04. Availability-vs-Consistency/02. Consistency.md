# **Consistency**

Consistency refers to the guarantee that all users or nodes in a distributed system see the same data at the same time. It ensures that whenever data is read from a system, it is always the latest and correct version.

> **Example:**
>
> -   Imagine a bank application. If you transfer ‚Çπ10,000 from Account A to Account B, both accounts should reflect the correct balances immediately.
> -   If Account A shows ‚Çπ10,000 deducted but Account B does not reflect the addition, the system is inconsistent.

---

## **2. Types of Consistency**

There are different levels of consistency in distributed systems:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Strong Consistency**

-   Every read returns the most recent write.
-   All nodes in the system see the same data at any time.
-   Example: **Relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)** enforce strict consistency.

> **Real-world Example:**
>
> -   When you check your bank balance after a transaction, it should always reflect the correct amount.

üîπ **Pros:** Guarantees correct data at all times.  
üîπ **Cons:** Slower performance, harder to scale in distributed systems.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Eventual Consistency**

-   Data updates are propagated **asynchronously**.
-   Reads may return stale (outdated) data for a short period.
-   After some time, all nodes will become consistent.
-   Example: **NoSQL databases like DynamoDB, Cassandra, and DNS systems** use eventual consistency.

> **Real-world Example:**
>
> -   When you post a comment on Facebook, it might not be visible to all your friends instantly, but after some seconds, it appears everywhere.

üîπ **Pros:** High availability and fast reads/writes.  
üîπ **Cons:** Users might see outdated data for a short period.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Causal Consistency**

-   If event A happens before event B, then all nodes will see A before B.
-   Example: If you "like" a post and then comment on it, all users should see your "like" before the comment.

> **Real-world Example:**
>
> -   On Twitter, if you reply to a tweet, users should see the original tweet first before your reply.

üîπ **Pros:** Preserves logical ordering of actions.  
üîπ **Cons:** Slightly complex to implement in large distributed systems.

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Read-Your-Own-Write Consistency**

-   A user always sees their latest writes, even if others see outdated data.
-   Example: If you update your Instagram profile picture, you should immediately see the change, even if others see the old picture for a while.

üîπ **Pros:** Improves user experience.  
üîπ **Cons:** May cause temporary inconsistencies for other users.

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Monotonic Read Consistency**

-   Ensures that once you read a value, you will never read an older version.
-   Example: If you check your email inbox and see 10 unread messages, you should not see 9 unread messages in a later refresh.

üîπ **Pros:** Prevents inconsistent views of data.  
üîπ **Cons:** Can be slow in distributed systems.

## **3. CAP Theorem and Consistency**

The **CAP Theorem** states that in a distributed system, you can only achieve two out of three guarantees:

| **Guarantee**               | **Description**                                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Consistency (C)**         | Every read returns the latest write.           |
| **Availability (A)**        | Every request gets a response (even if stale). |
| **Partition Tolerance (P)** | The system works even if some nodes fail.      |

-   **CP Systems (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)**: Prioritizes consistency (e.g., relational databases like PostgreSQL).
-   **AP Systems (Availability + Partition Tolerance)**: Prioritizes availability (e.g., DynamoDB, Cassandra).
-   **CA Systems (Consistency + Availability)**: Impossible in distributed systems, as network failures always occur.

## **4. Techniques to Ensure Consistency**

### ‚úÖ **Distributed Transactions (ACID)**

-   **Atomicity:** Transactions are all-or-nothing.
-   **Consistency:** Data is always valid after a transaction.
-   **Isolation:** Transactions do not interfere with each other.
-   **Durability:** Data persists even after failures.

Used in **SQL databases** for strict consistency.

---

### ‚úÖ **Quorum-Based Consistency**

-   A write is successful only if a majority of nodes acknowledge it.
-   Example: In a **3-node system**, at least 2 nodes must confirm a write before it is considered successful.

Used in **Apache Cassandra, Amazon DynamoDB**.

---

### ‚úÖ **Vector Clocks**

-   Tracks the order of operations using timestamps.
-   Helps resolve conflicts in eventual consistency.

Used in **Amazon DynamoDB, Riak**.

### ‚úÖ **Consistency Models in Databases**

| **Database Type**       | **Consistency Model**             |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **PostgreSQL, MySQL**   | Strong Consistency                |
| **MongoDB**             | Configurable (Strong or Eventual) |
| **DynamoDB, Cassandra** | Eventual Consistency              |

---

## **5. Trade-offs in Consistency**

| **Approach**             | **Pros**                 | **Cons**             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| **Strong Consistency**   | Guarantees accurate data | Slower performance   |
| **Eventual Consistency** | Faster, more scalable    | Temporary stale data |
| **Causal Consistency**   | Preserves logical order  | Harder to implement  |

## **6. Real-World Examples**

| **Application**              | **Consistency Model**               | **Why?**                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Bank Transactions**        | **Strong Consistency**              | Incorrect balances cause serious issues.  |
| **Facebook News Feed**       | **Eventual Consistency**            | Prioritizes speed over instant updates.   |
| **WhatsApp Messages**        | **Causal Consistency**              | Messages must appear in order.            |
| **E-commerce Cart (Amazon)** | **Read-Your-Own-Write Consistency** | Users see their cart updates immediately. |

## **7. Conclusion**

Consistency is a critical concept in system design, balancing data correctness with performance. Choosing the right consistency model depends on the application‚Äôs needs.
