# **Availability Patterns in Distributed Systems**

Availability refers to the ability of a system to remain operational and accessible to users **without unexpected downtime**. It is crucial for designing **highly reliable** and **fault-tolerant** systems.

---

---

## 1. **Availability in Numbers**

Availability is usually expressed as a **percentage of uptime** and is commonly measured using the **"number of 9s" (nines)**. More **nines** mean higher availability and lower downtime.

| **Availability Level** | **Common Name** | **Downtime per Year** | **Downtime per Month** | **Downtime per Day** |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| **90.0%**              | One 9           | **36.5 days**         | **72 hours**           | **2.4 hours**        |
| **99.0%**              | Two 9s          | **3.65 days**         | **7.2 hours**          | **14.4 minutes**     |
| **99.9%**              | Three 9s        | **8h 41m 38s**        | **43m 28s**            | **1m 26s**           |
| **99.99%**             | Four 9s         | **52m 9.8s**          | **4m 21s**             | **8.6s**             |
| **99.999%**            | Five 9s         | **5m 15s**            | **26.3s**              | **864ms**            |

-   **99.9% ("Three 9s")**: Common for **web services**. Some minor downtime is acceptable.
-   **99.99% ("Four 9s")**: Used for **enterprise systems** where uptime is critical.
-   **99.999% ("Five 9s")**: Used in **mission-critical systems** (e.g., payment processing, telecom networks).

📌 **Key Takeaway:** **Even small increases in availability require significant engineering effort.**

---

## **Availability in Parallel vs. In Sequence**

A distributed system is often composed of **multiple components** (e.g., databases, application servers, caches, load balancers). The availability of the overall system depends on how these components are connected.

### **1️⃣ Availability in Sequence (Serial Dependency)**

-   If multiple components depend on each other **sequentially**, the overall availability **decreases**.
-   If **one component fails, the entire system fails**.
-   The total availability is the **product** of individual availabilities.

#### **Formula:**

\[
Availability*{Total} = Availability*{A} \times Availability\_{B}
\]

#### **Example:**

-   **Component A** has **99.9%** availability.
-   **Component B** has **99.9%** availability.
-   **Total availability:**  
    \[
    0.999 \times 0.999 = 0.998 = 99.8\%
    \]
-   This means an **extra 17.3 minutes of downtime per month** compared to a single component with 99.9% availability.

📌 **Key Takeaway:** **Avoid unnecessary dependencies between services in a sequential chain.**

---

### **2️⃣ Availability in Parallel (Redundancy and Failover)**

-   If multiple components work **in parallel**, the system can survive failures.
-   Even if **one component fails, another takes over**, improving availability.
-   The total availability is calculated using the **complementary probability**.

#### **Formula:**

\[
Availability\_{Total} = 1 - (1 - Availability_A) \times (1 - Availability_B)
\]

#### **Example:**

-   **Component A** has **99.9%** availability.
-   **Component B** has **99.9%** availability.
-   **Total availability:**  
    \[
    1 - (1 - 0.999) \times (1 - 0.999) = 1 - 0.000001 = 99.9999\%
    \]

✅ **Parallel redundancy improves availability significantly!**

-   **A system with two 99.9% components in parallel has an availability of 99.9999%.**
-   This reduces **downtime to just 32 seconds per year!**

📌 **Key Takeaway:** **Use redundancy (replication, failover mechanisms) to improve availability.**

---

## **High-Availability (HA) Strategies**

To **achieve high availability**, systems use several engineering patterns:

### **1️⃣ Load Balancing**

-   Distributes traffic across **multiple servers** to prevent overloading.
-   Example: **NGINX, AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**.

### **2️⃣ Replication (Data Redundancy)**

-   Keeps multiple **copies of data** across different servers/data centers.
-   Example: **Primary-Replica databases, NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Cassandra)**.

### **3️⃣ Failover Mechanisms**

-   If one server fails, another takes over **automatically**.
-   Example: **Database failover in PostgreSQL, Redis Sentinel**.

### **4️⃣ Disaster Recovery & Backups**

-   Regular backups and replication across **geo-distributed** locations.
-   Example: **AWS Multi-AZ RDS, Google Spanner**.

### **5️⃣ Auto-scaling & Self-healing Systems**

-   Cloud platforms automatically **replace failed instances**.
-   Example: **Kubernetes auto-scaling, AWS Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)**.

---

## **Final Thoughts**

-   Availability is measured in **"nines"**, with more **nines meaning less downtime**.
-   **Sequential components** decrease availability, while **parallel components** improve it.
-   **Redundancy, replication, failover, and load balancing** help improve **high availability** (HA).

## 2. **Failover in Distributed Systems**

Failover is a **high-availability (HA) strategy** that ensures a system remains operational **even if a failure occurs**. It involves switching from a **primary (active) component** to a **backup (passive) component** when a failure is detected.

Failover is critical for **mission-critical applications**, such as:  
✅ **Databases** (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)  
✅ **Cloud services** (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)  
✅ **Load balancers & web servers**

## **How Failover Works**

1. The system constantly **monitors** the primary (active) component using **health checks** (e.g., heartbeats).
2. If a failure is detected, the system **automatically switches** to the backup (standby) component.
3. The backup component **takes over operations** with minimal downtime.

This process is often **automated** using failover mechanisms such as:

-   **Load balancers** (e.g., AWS Elastic Load Balancer, NGINX)
-   **Database replication** (e.g., PostgreSQL replication, MySQL failover clusters)
-   **Cloud failover services** (e.g., AWS Route 53 health checks)

---

## **Types of Failover Strategies**

Failover can be **designed differently** depending on how the backup system is structured.

### **1️⃣ Active-Passive Failover (Master-Slave)**

💡 **Only one server is active, and a passive (backup) server is on standby.**

🔹 **How It Works:**

-   The **primary server** handles all requests.
-   A **secondary server** remains idle (passive).
-   A **heartbeat signal** is sent between them to check if the primary is healthy.
-   If the **primary server fails**, the secondary **becomes active** and takes over the workload.

🔹 **Hot vs. Cold Standby:**

-   **Hot Standby**: The passive server is already running and ready to take over **instantly**.
-   **Cold Standby**: The passive server is shut down and must **boot up first**, increasing failover time.

📌 **Example:**

-   **PostgreSQL Failover**: A primary database is replicated to a secondary database. If the primary fails, the secondary becomes the new primary.

🔹 **Advantages:**  
✅ Lower resource usage (only one server handles traffic at a time).  
✅ Easy to implement using **database replication** or **load balancers**.

🔹 **Disadvantages:**  
❌ Slower failover compared to active-active (since only one server is actively serving).  
❌ If the primary fails before data is replicated, **data loss can occur**.

---

### **2️⃣ Active-Active Failover (Master-Master)**

💡 **Both servers are active and share the workload.**

🔹 **How It Works:**

-   Two or more servers process requests **simultaneously**.
-   Load balancing ensures **traffic is evenly distributed**.
-   If one server fails, the remaining server(s) **handle all traffic**.

📌 **Example:**

-   **Web servers behind a Load Balancer** (e.g., AWS Elastic Load Balancer with multiple EC2 instances).
-   **Database Clusters** (e.g., MySQL Galera Cluster, MongoDB Replica Sets).

🔹 **Advantages:**  
✅ **Zero downtime failover** (since both servers are active).  
✅ **Better performance** (workload is distributed).

🔹 **Disadvantages:**  
❌ More **complexity** (synchronization between servers is required).  
❌ **Data conflicts** can occur if multiple servers write to the same database.

## **Comparison: Active-Passive vs. Active-Active**

| **Feature**                  | **Active-Passive**                           | **Active-Active**                                            |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Number of Active Servers** | 1 active, 1 passive                          | Multiple active servers                                      |
| **Failover Time**            | Can be slow (depends on heartbeat detection) | Instant failover                                             |
| **Performance**              | Only 1 server handles traffic                | Load is shared across multiple servers                       |
| **Data Loss Risk**           | Possible if replication lags                 | Lower risk (both servers process traffic)                    |
| **Complexity**               | Simple to set up                             | More complex (requires load balancing & conflict resolution) |

## **Disadvantages of Failover**

Despite its benefits, failover introduces **challenges**:

1️⃣ **Increased Hardware & Costs** 💰

-   Additional servers are required for **redundancy**.

2️⃣ **Failover Delay** ⏳

-   Some downtime may occur during the **switching process** (especially in active-passive).

3️⃣ **Potential Data Loss** 🔥

-   If the primary system fails before data is replicated, **recent transactions may be lost**.

4️⃣ **Complexity in Active-Active Setups** 🤯

-   Active-active requires **synchronization mechanisms** to **prevent data conflicts**.

---

## **Best Practices for Failover Implementation**

✅ **Automate Failover Detection**: Use health checks (e.g., Kubernetes liveness probes, AWS Route 53).  
✅ **Use Redundancy & Replication**: Keep multiple backups across **geographically distributed data centers**.  
✅ **Test Failover Regularly**: Run **chaos engineering** tests (e.g., Netflix’s **Chaos Monkey**) to simulate failures.  
✅ **Choose the Right Strategy**: Use **Active-Passive** for databases, **Active-Active** for web applications.  
✅ **Minimize Data Loss**: Implement **synchronous replication** (if possible) to prevent data inconsistency.

---

## **Final Thoughts**

-   **Failover is critical** for ensuring high availability and system resilience.
-   **Active-Passive** is simpler but may cause delays; **Active-Active** provides better performance but is complex.
-   **Proper monitoring, replication, and testing** help minimize downtime and data loss.

# **Replication in Distributed Systems**

## **What is Replication?**

Replication is a **high-availability pattern** used in distributed systems to improve **fault tolerance, performance, and reliability**. It involves maintaining multiple copies of the same **data** across **different locations or nodes**.

### **Why is Replication Important?**

✅ **Ensures High Availability** – If one node fails, another replica serves the request.  
✅ **Improves Performance** – Distributes read operations across multiple nodes, reducing latency.  
✅ **Enhances Fault Tolerance** – System remains functional even if some replicas fail.  
✅ **Supports Disaster Recovery** – Data remains accessible even in case of regional failures.

## **Types of Replication**

### **1️⃣ Master-Slave Replication (Primary-Replica)**

💡 **A single master (primary) handles all write operations, while multiple slaves (replicas) handle read operations.**

🔹 **How It Works:**

-   The **master server** is responsible for all **write** operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
-   **Slave servers** replicate data from the master and handle **read** operations (SELECT).
-   If the master fails, a **failover mechanism** promotes a slave to become the new master.

📌 **Example:**

-   **MySQL Replication** (Primary-Replica)
-   **PostgreSQL Streaming Replication**
-   **MongoDB Replica Sets**

🔹 **Advantages:**  
✅ **Read scalability** – Multiple slaves handle read queries.  
✅ **Easier conflict resolution** – Only one master updates data.  
✅ **Simpler setup** – Less complex than Master-Master.

🔹 **Disadvantages:**  
❌ **Write bottleneck** – Only one master can handle writes.  
❌ **Failover delay** – If the master fails, a new master must be elected, causing downtime.  
❌ **Data inconsistency risk** – Slaves may lag behind the master due to replication delays.

---

### **2️⃣ Master-Master Replication (Multi-Primary Replication)**

💡 **Multiple masters handle both read and write operations.**

🔹 **How It Works:**

-   Multiple **master servers** accept both **read and write** requests.
-   Changes are replicated **bi-directionally** between all masters.
-   Load balancers or application logic decide which master to use for a request.

📌 **Example:**

-   **MySQL Galera Cluster**
-   **Cassandra Multi-Master Replication**
-   **MongoDB Sharded Clusters**

🔹 **Advantages:**  
✅ **High availability** – Any master can handle requests.  
✅ **No single point of failure** – System stays operational even if a master fails.  
✅ **Better write scalability** – Multiple nodes handle write operations.

🔹 **Disadvantages:**  
❌ **Data conflicts** – If two masters update the same data simultaneously, conflicts arise.  
❌ **Increased complexity** – Requires conflict resolution strategies.  
❌ **Higher latency** – Synchronization between masters may slow down transactions.

## **Comparison: Master-Slave vs. Master-Master**

| **Feature**           | **Master-Slave**        | **Master-Master**                  |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Write Scalability** | Low (single master)     | High (multiple masters)            |
| **Read Scalability**  | High (many slaves)      | High (many masters)                |
| **Conflict Handling** | Simple (one writer)     | Complex (multiple writers)         |
| **Failover**          | Needs promotion         | Instant failover                   |
| **Complexity**        | Low                     | High                               |
| **Use Case**          | Read-heavy applications | Write-intensive, multi-region apps |

---

## **Replication Strategies**

### **1️⃣ Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Replication**

| **Replication Type** | **How It Works**                                                          | **Pros**                          | **Cons**                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Synchronous**      | Data is written to all replicas before confirming the write               | Ensures strong consistency        | Slower writes, increased latency                         |
| **Asynchronous**     | Write is confirmed immediately, and replication happens in the background | Faster writes, better performance | Risk of data loss if the master fails before replication |

📌 **Example:**

-   **Synchronous**: Used in **financial systems** where consistency is critical.
-   **Asynchronous**: Used in **social media platforms** where speed matters more than consistency.

---

## **Conflict Resolution in Master-Master Replication**

Since multiple masters can **update the same data**, conflicts can arise. Common **conflict resolution strategies** include:

1️⃣ **Last Write Wins (LWW):** The latest timestamped update is kept.  
2️⃣ **Operational Transformation:** Conflict resolution logic merges changes.  
3️⃣ **Application-Level Handling:** Developers decide how to merge conflicting updates.  
4️⃣ **Vector Clocks:** Tracks the history of changes to resolve conflicts.

📌 **Example:**

-   **Cassandra** uses **LWW** to resolve conflicts.
-   **Google Docs** uses **Operational Transformation** to allow real-time collaboration.

---

## **Use Cases for Replication**

✅ **Web Applications** – Load-balancing read requests across replicas improves performance.  
✅ **Global Databases** – Multi-region replication ensures low-latency access worldwide.  
✅ **Data Warehousing** – Keeping replicas of large datasets enables efficient analytics.  
✅ **Disaster Recovery** – Replication ensures data availability in case of failures.

---

## **Best Practices for Replication**

✅ **Monitor Replication Lag** – Use metrics to detect delays in data synchronization.  
✅ **Automate Failover** – Set up automatic master election in case of failure.  
✅ **Optimize Load Balancing** – Distribute read and write traffic efficiently.  
✅ **Regularly Test Disaster Recovery** – Ensure data can be restored quickly.  
✅ **Choose the Right Replication Strategy** – Use **Master-Slave** for read-heavy workloads, **Master-Master** for multi-region high-availability applications.

---

## **Final Thoughts**

Replication is a **core concept** in distributed systems that improves **availability, scalability, and fault tolerance**. However, it **introduces challenges** like **data consistency, conflict resolution, and increased complexity**. Choosing the **right replication strategy** depends on your system's needs.
