# **Domain Name System (DNS)**

The **Domain Name System (DNS)** is a decentralized naming system that translates **human-readable domain names** (like `www.example.com`) into **machine-readable IP addresses** (like `192.168.1.1`).

This is necessary because while **humans** find it easier to remember domain names, **computers and network devices** communicate using IP addresses.

üîπ **Example:**

-   You enter `www.google.com` in your browser.
-   Your computer queries a DNS server to get its corresponding IP address (`142.250.190.46`).
-   Your browser uses this IP address to communicate with Google‚Äôs servers.

---

## **How DNS Works (Step-by-Step)**

DNS resolution involves multiple steps before returning an IP address.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ User Request**

-   A user enters a domain name (e.g., `www.example.com`) into a web browser.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Browser Cache Check**

-   The browser first checks if it already has a cached IP address for this domain.
-   If found, the request is resolved instantly.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ OS Cache Check**

-   If the browser does not have the IP address, the operating system (OS) checks its cache.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Recursive DNS Resolver Query**

-   If the OS cache doesn‚Äôt have it, the request is sent to a **Recursive DNS Resolver** (provided by your ISP or a third-party like Google DNS or Cloudflare DNS).

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Root DNS Server Query**

-   The Recursive Resolver checks with the **Root DNS Server** (the top-level authority) to find where to look next.

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ TLD (Top-Level Domain) Server Query**

-   The Root Server directs the request to a **TLD Server** based on the domain extension (`.com`, `.net`, `.org`, etc.).

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Authoritative DNS Server Query**

-   The TLD Server points to the **Authoritative Name Server** for `example.com`, which holds the final answer.

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ IP Address Returned**

-   The **Authoritative DNS Server** returns the IP address to the Recursive Resolver.
-   The resolver stores this IP in its cache and forwards it to the user‚Äôs browser.

### **9Ô∏è‚É£ Website Loads**

-   The browser sends an HTTP request to the returned IP address, and the website loads.

‚è≥ **Time Taken:** This entire process happens in milliseconds!

## **DNS Components**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ DNS Records** (Types of DNS Entries)

DNS operates using different record types to define how domain names should be resolved.

| **Record Type**            | **Description**                                           | **Example**                           |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **A Record**               | Maps a domain to an IPv4 address                          | `example.com ‚Üí 192.168.1.1`           |
| **AAAA Record**            | Maps a domain to an IPv6 address                          | `example.com ‚Üí 2001:db8::1`           |
| **CNAME (Canonical Name)** | Points a domain alias to another domain                   | `www.example.com ‚Üí example.com`       |
| **MX (Mail Exchange)**     | Defines mail servers for email routing                    | `example.com ‚Üí mail.google.com`       |
| **NS (Name Server)**       | Specifies authoritative name servers                      | `example.com ‚Üí ns1.example.com`       |
| **TXT (Text Record)**      | Stores arbitrary text, often for verification or security | `SPF, DKIM, DMARC for email security` |
| **SRV (Service Record)**   | Defines location of specific services                     | `Used in SIP, XMPP, LDAP`             |
| **PTR (Pointer Record)**   | Used for reverse DNS lookups                              | `192.168.1.1 ‚Üí example.com`           |

## **DNS Caching**

To reduce latency, **DNS responses** are **cached** at multiple levels.

| **Cache Level**                | **Where It‚Äôs Stored**                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Browser Cache**              | Browser stores DNS responses                                      |
| **OS Cache**                   | Operating system caches recent queries                            |
| **Recursive Resolver Cache**   | DNS resolver caches responses for multiple users                  |
| **ISP Cache**                  | Internet Service Providers store popular lookups                  |
| **Authoritative Server Cache** | Some responses are cached directly at the authoritative DNS level |

üïí **TTL (Time To Live):** Each DNS record has a TTL value that defines how long a record can be cached before a fresh lookup is required.

## **DNS Hierarchy**

DNS is structured **hierarchically** into different levels.

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Root Name Servers** (.)

-   13 globally distributed root servers.
-   Direct requests to the correct **TLD servers**.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Top-Level Domain (TLD) Servers** (`.com`, `.org`, `.net`, etc.)

-   Maintained by registries like **Verisign (`.com, .net`)** or **ICANN**.
-   Direct queries to the correct **Authoritative Name Servers**.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Authoritative Name Servers**

-   The final source of truth for a domain‚Äôs IP address.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Recursive Resolvers**

-   Provided by ISPs (`1.1.1.1 - Cloudflare`, `8.8.8.8 - Google DNS`).
-   Perform lookups on behalf of users.

---

## **DNS Load Balancing Methods**

DNS can be used to distribute traffic efficiently across multiple servers.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Weighted Round Robin**

-   Assigns different weights to multiple IPs.
-   Helps balance traffic based on server capacity.
-   Used for **A/B Testing** and **Server Failover**.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Latency-Based Routing**

-   Directs traffic to the closest or fastest server.
-   Reduces **latency** for users by routing to the lowest-ping server.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Geolocation-Based Routing**

-   Routes users to servers based on their geographical location.
-   Useful for **content delivery networks (CDNs)** and **localized services**.

üìå **Example:**

-   **Google DNS (8.8.8.8)** directs Indian users to servers in **Mumbai**, while US users are directed to **California servers**.

## **Managed DNS Services**

Many cloud providers offer **managed DNS** with enhanced features.

üîπ **Popular DNS Services:**  
‚úÖ **Cloudflare DNS** ‚Äì Secure & fast with built-in DDoS protection.  
‚úÖ **Amazon Route 53** ‚Äì Scalable, integrates with AWS services.

# Domain Name parts:

A **domain name** consists of multiple parts, each serving a specific function. Let‚Äôs break it down using an example:

### Example Domain:

`www.example.com`

### 1. **Subdomain (`www`)**

-   The `www` (World Wide Web) is a **subdomain** that traditionally represents a website.
-   Other subdomains like `blog.example.com` or `store.example.com` can be used for different sections of a website.
-   Subdomains are optional.

### 2. **Second-Level Domain (SLD) (`example`)**

-   This is the main part of the domain name that represents a brand, company, or organization.
-   It is unique within the **Top-Level Domain (TLD)** it belongs to.
-   Examples: `google`, `amazon`, `github` in `google.com`, `amazon.com`, `github.com`.

### 3. **Top-Level Domain (TLD) (`.com`)**

-   This is the highest part of the domain hierarchy.
-   TLDs are categorized into:
    -   **Generic TLDs (gTLDs)**: `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, `.info`
    -   **Country-Code TLDs (ccTLDs)**: `.in` (India), `.uk` (United Kingdom), `.us` (United States)
    -   **Sponsored TLDs (sTLDs)**: `.gov` (government), `.edu` (education), `.mil` (military)

### 4. **Root Domain (`example.com`)**

-   The combination of the **SLD** and **TLD** (`example.com`) is called the **root domain**.
-   It is the primary address of a website.

### 5. **Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)**

-   The **FQDN** includes all parts, like `www.example.com.` (note the trailing dot, which represents the root DNS).
