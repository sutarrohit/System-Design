# 1. What is System Design?

System Design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data flow of a system to meet specific requirements. It is an essential phase in software development that ensures a system is **scalable, reliable, maintainable, and efficient**.

### Key Aspects of System Design:

1. **High-Level Design (HLD)** â€“ Focuses on the overall architecture, major components, and how they interact.
2. **Low-Level Design (LLD)** â€“ Defines detailed aspects of each component, including database schemas, APIs, algorithms, and data structures.

### Steps in System Design:

1. **Understanding Requirements** â€“ Functional (features) and Non-Functional (scalability, security, performance).
2. **Defining System Architecture** â€“ Monolithic vs. Microservices, Client-Server, Distributed Systems.
3. **Choosing Databases** â€“ SQL vs. NoSQL, caching strategies, indexing, partitioning.
4. **Designing APIs** â€“ REST vs. GraphQL, API versioning, authentication mechanisms.
5. **Handling Scalability & Performance** â€“ Load balancing, replication, sharding, CDN.
6. **Ensuring Reliability** â€“ Fault tolerance, redundancy, backups, failover strategies.
7. **Security Considerations** â€“ Authentication, authorization, data encryption.
8. **Monitoring & Logging** â€“ Observability, alerting, logging systems.

### System Design in Interviews

System design is a crucial aspect of software engineering interviews, especially for senior-level roles. Candidates are expected to:

-   Analyze and break down the problem.
-   Propose a high-level architecture.
-   Discuss trade-offs (latency vs. throughput, CAP theorem).
-   Optimize for scalability, fault tolerance, and cost-efficiency.

# 2. **How to Approach System Design?**

System Design follows a structured approach to ensure a **scalable, reliable, and efficient** solution. Below are the key steps to systematically design a system:

### **1. Understand the Problem**

-   **Gather Requirements:** Identify **functional** (features) and **non-functional** (scalability, performance, security) requirements.
-   **Clarify Ambiguities:** Ask questions to refine the problem scope and constraints.
-   **Identify Users & Use Cases:** Who will use the system? How will they interact with it?

ðŸ“Œ _Example:_ If designing **a URL shortener**, ask:

-   Should URLs expire?
-   How much traffic should the system handle?
-   Should it support analytics for URL clicks?

---

### **2. Define the Scope of the System**

-   **What the system should do** (core functionalities).
-   **What the system wonâ€™t do** (out-of-scope features).

ðŸ“Œ _Example:_

-   A **messaging app** may support **text and image sharing**, but **video calls** could be out of scope initially.

---

### **3. Research & Analyze Existing Systems**

-   Study similar systems (**TinyURL, WhatsApp, YouTube**).
-   Identify **best practices, common failures, and trade-offs**.

ðŸ“Œ _Example:_ If designing a **ride-sharing app**, research Uberâ€™s **geolocation, matching algorithms, surge pricing**.

---

### **4. Create a High-Level Design (HLD)**

-   Identify major **components**: APIs, databases, caching, load balancing, etc.
-   Define **architecture**: Monolith vs. Microservices.
-   Use **diagrams** (flowcharts, component diagrams).

ðŸ“Œ _Example:_ A **social media app** might include:

-   **Frontend**: React/Next.js
-   **Backend**: Node.js, GraphQL APIs
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL (SQL for relational data)
-   **Caching**: Redis (for frequently accessed posts)
-   **CDN**: Cloudflare (for fast image loading)

---

### **5. Refine the Design (LLD - Low-Level Design)**

-   **Choose a Database:** SQL vs. NoSQL? Partitioning, indexing.
-   **Define API Contracts:** REST or GraphQL, authentication methods.
-   **Handle Scaling:** Load balancers, database replication, sharding.
-   **Plan Caching Strategies:** Redis/Memcached to reduce DB load.

ðŸ“Œ _Example:_ For a **video streaming service**, use:

-   **CDN (Content Delivery Network)** for caching videos.
-   **Chunked Streaming (HLS, DASH)** for adaptive playback.
-   **Load Balancers** to distribute traffic.

---

### **6. Document the Design**

-   Write detailed **design docs** for future maintenance.
-   Include diagrams, API contracts, database schema.
-   Add **scalability and failure recovery** strategies.

---

### **7. Monitor & Improve the System**

-   Use **logging & monitoring** (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK).
-   Implement **automated scaling** (Kubernetes, AWS Auto Scaling).
-   Optimize for cost, performance, and user experience.

---

### **Conclusion**

System design is an **iterative process**. Always focus on:  
âœ… Scalability â€“ Can it handle more users?  
âœ… Reliability â€“ Does it recover from failures?  
âœ… Performance â€“ How fast does it respond?  
âœ… Maintainability â€“ Is it easy to update?
