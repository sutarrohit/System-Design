# **Throughput**

Throughput is the rate at which a system processes requests or data over a given period. It is a key performance metric that indicates how efficiently a system can handle load.

> **Formula for Throughput:**  
> \[
> \text{Throughput} = \frac{\text{Total Requests Processed}}{\text{Time Taken}}
> \]
> It is usually measured in **requests per second (RPS), transactions per second (TPS), or gigabits per second (Gbps)** depending on the system type.

## **2. Throughput vs. Latency**

Throughput and latency are related but different concepts:

| Metric         | Definition                                         |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Latency**    | The time taken for a single request to complete.   |
| **Throughput** | The number of requests processed per unit of time. |

-   **Low latency does not always mean high throughput.** A system may respond quickly to individual requests but handle fewer requests per second.
-   **High throughput does not always mean low latency.** A system might process many requests simultaneously but take longer to respond.

> **Example:**
>
> -   A water pipe analogy: **Latency** is the time it takes for water to flow from one end to another, while **throughput** is the amount of water that passes through per second.

## **3. Types of Throughput**

1. **Network Throughput** – Measures the data transfer rate over a network (e.g., Gbps).
2. **Disk Throughput** – Measures how fast data can be read from or written to a disk.
3. **Database Throughput** – Measures the number of queries processed per second.
4. **Application Throughput** – Measures the number of API requests handled per second.

## **4. Factors Affecting Throughput**

Several factors influence throughput in a system:

### **a. System Resources**

-   **CPU:** A limited number of CPU cores can become a bottleneck.
-   **Memory (RAM):** Insufficient RAM can cause excessive disk swapping, reducing throughput.
-   **Disk I/O:** Slow disks (e.g., HDDs) limit the rate at which data is read/written.

### **b. Network Performance**

-   **Bandwidth:** A lower bandwidth restricts data transfer speed.
-   **Packet Loss & Congestion:** High congestion leads to retries, reducing throughput.
-   **Round Trip Time (RTT):** Higher RTT increases delays and reduces effective throughput.

### **c. Software Design**

-   **Inefficient Code:** Poorly optimized algorithms consume more CPU/memory.
-   **Lock Contention:** Excessive locking in databases or multithreaded applications reduces concurrent processing.
-   **Serialization & Deserialization:** Converting data formats (e.g., JSON to binary) can slow down processing.

### **d. Workload Characteristics**

-   **Read vs. Write Operations:** Write-heavy workloads often have lower throughput due to database consistency requirements.
-   **Batch Processing vs. Streaming:** Streaming processes data continuously, while batch processing handles large chunks at once.

## **5. How to Increase Throughput?**

✅ **Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out):**

-   Add more machines (e.g., using Kubernetes, AWS Auto Scaling).
-   Example: Adding more servers behind a **Load Balancer**.

✅ **Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up):**

-   Increase CPU, RAM, or storage of existing machines.
-   Example: Upgrading to a more powerful database instance.

✅ **Load Balancing:**

-   Distribute traffic among multiple servers.
-   Example: Using **NGINX or AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**.

✅ **Caching:**

-   Store frequently accessed data in memory (e.g., Redis, Memcached).
-   Example: Serving API responses from cache instead of querying the database.

✅ **Asynchronous Processing:**

-   Use **message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)** to process tasks in the background.
-   Example: A payment system where transactions are processed asynchronously.

✅ **Database Optimizations:**

-   **Indexing:** Speeds up queries.
-   **Partitioning & Sharding:** Distributes data across multiple servers.
-   **Replication:** Reduces read bottlenecks by distributing load.

✅ **Optimize Network Performance:**

-   Use **CDNs (Content Delivery Networks)** to serve static content faster.
-   Compress data using **gzip** or **Brotli** to reduce payload size.

## **6. Real-World Examples**

### **a. High Throughput Systems**

1. **Google Search** – Processes **63,000+ searches per second** using a combination of caching, distributed indexing, and load balancing.
2. **Amazon E-Commerce** – Handles **millions of transactions per second** during peak shopping hours.
3. **WhatsApp Messaging** – Uses **asynchronous messaging queues** to process billions of messages daily.

### **b. Low Throughput Systems (Bottlenecks)**

1. **Single-Threaded APIs** – A server handling one request at a time limits throughput.
2. **Synchronous Database Calls** – Blocking calls cause delays and reduce system efficiency.

## **7. Trade-offs in Improving Throughput**

-   **More Servers = Higher Costs:** Scaling horizontally increases infrastructure costs.
-   **Caching vs. Data Freshness:** Cached data may become stale.
-   **Eventual Consistency vs. Strong Consistency:** High-throughput distributed systems often trade strong consistency for speed (e.g., NoSQL databases).

## **8. Conclusion**

Throughput is a critical metric in system design, affecting the performance and scalability of applications. Optimizing throughput requires a combination of **scaling, caching, load balancing, and efficient data processing techniques**.
