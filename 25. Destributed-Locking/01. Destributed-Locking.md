# 🔒 **Distributed Locking: A Detailed Explanation**

**Distributed locking** is a mechanism used in **distributed systems** to ensure that only **one process (or node)** can access a shared resource at a time. It helps **prevent race conditions** and **data inconsistencies** in environments where multiple instances of an application run concurrently.

---

## 🚀 **Why Do We Need Distributed Locks?**

In a single-server application, locking is simple (e.g., using database row locks or in-memory locks). However, in a **distributed system** where multiple servers or microservices interact, we need a way to **synchronize access** across different nodes.

### ✅ **Common Use Cases**

-   **Preventing duplicate transactions** (e.g., ensuring a user does not purchase the same item twice).
-   **Leader election** (choosing a single active node in a cluster).
-   **Ensuring job uniqueness** in distributed task queues (e.g., preventing the same job from running twice).
-   **Managing resource allocation** (e.g., a cloud system ensuring that only one node provisions a resource).

---

## 🔑 **How Does Distributed Locking Work?**

A **distributed lock** should have the following properties:

1. **Mutual Exclusion** – Only one client can hold the lock at a time.
2. **Fault Tolerance** – If a client crashes, the lock should release automatically.
3. **Deadlock Prevention** – Avoid situations where a lock is never released.
4. **Fairness** – Ensure locks are granted in a fair order.

A **distributed lock** is typically implemented using:

-   **Databases** (MySQL/PostgreSQL locking).
-   **Distributed Caches** (Redis-based locking).
-   **Distributed Coordination Services** (Zookeeper, etcd, Consul).

## 🛠 **Distributed Locking Implementations**

### 1️⃣ **Using Redis (SET NX)**

Redis provides a simple and fast way to implement a **distributed lock** using the `SET NX` (SET if Not eXists) command.

📌 **Steps to Implement:**

1. Try to **acquire the lock** using:
    ```plaintext
    SET lock_key "lock_value" NX PX 5000
    ```
    - `NX` → Ensures the key is set only if it does not exist.
    - `PX 5000` → Expires the lock after 5000ms (prevents deadlocks).
2. If successful, the client has the lock.
3. If another client tries to acquire it, it fails.
4. After completing the task, the client **releases the lock**:
    ```plaintext
    DEL lock_key
    ```
5. If the client crashes, the lock auto-expires (ensuring no deadlock).

✅ **Pros:**

-   Fast, **low latency**.
-   Supports **automatic expiration** to prevent deadlocks.

❌ **Cons:**

-   **Not 100% reliable** in cases of network partitions (use Redlock for better safety).

---

### 2️⃣ **Using Redlock (Reliable Redis Lock)**

Redlock is an **improved algorithm** for **distributed locking with Redis** that prevents **single-point failures**.

📌 **How It Works:**

1. Use **multiple Redis nodes** (e.g., 5 instances).
2. A client **writes the lock** to at least **3/5 nodes** to acquire the lock.
3. If successful, the lock is granted.
4. To release, the client deletes the key from all nodes.

✅ **Pros:**

-   Resistant to **network failures**.
-   Works across **multiple data centers**.

❌ **Cons:**

-   More **complex** than simple Redis locking.
-   Requires **synchronization** across Redis instances.

---

### 3️⃣ **Using MySQL/PostgreSQL Locks**

Databases provide **row-level** or **table-level** locks to achieve distributed locking.

📌 **Example with MySQL:**

```sql
SELECT GET_LOCK('my_lock', 10);
```

-   This **acquires a lock** named `'my_lock'` for 10 seconds.
-   Other queries **wait** until the lock is released.

To release the lock:

```sql
SELECT RELEASE_LOCK('my_lock');
```

✅ **Pros:**

-   **Easy to use** if a database is already part of the system.
-   **Persistent** (locks survive Redis crashes).

❌ **Cons:**

-   **Slower** than Redis due to database overhead.
-   **Scalability issues** (does not work well for very large distributed systems).

---

### 4️⃣ **Using Zookeeper (Strongly Consistent Lock)**

Zookeeper provides **strong distributed locks** using its **ZNodes (ephemeral nodes)**.

📌 **How It Works:**

1. A process creates a **ZNode** (`/lock/node_1`).
2. Other processes try to create the same ZNode.
    - If it **exists**, they wait.
    - If it **does not exist**, they get the lock.
3. When the process completes, it **deletes** the ZNode.
4. The next waiting process gets the lock.

✅ **Pros:**

-   **Strong consistency guarantees** (better than Redis).
-   **Leader election support** (used in Kafka, Hadoop).

❌ **Cons:**

-   **More complex** setup than Redis/MySQL.
-   **Higher latency** compared to Redis.

## 🚀 **Example: Implementing a Redis Lock in Node.js**

Here's how you can implement **distributed locking** in **Node.js using Redis**:

```javascript
const { createClient } = require("redis");

const client = createClient();

async function acquireLock(lockKey, lockValue, expireTime) {
    const result = await client.set(lockKey, lockValue, { NX: true, PX: expireTime });
    return result === "OK";
}

async function releaseLock(lockKey, lockValue) {
    const script = `
        if redis.call("GET", KEYS[1]) == ARGV[1] then
            return redis.call("DEL", KEYS[1])
        else
            return 0
        end
    `;
    return await client.eval(script, [lockKey], [lockValue]);
}

async function main() {
    await client.connect();
    const lockKey = "resource_lock";
    const lockValue = "unique_id_123";

    if (await acquireLock(lockKey, lockValue, 5000)) {
        console.log("Lock acquired!");
        setTimeout(async () => {
            await releaseLock(lockKey, lockValue);
            console.log("Lock released!");
            await client.quit();
        }, 3000);
    } else {
        console.log("Failed to acquire lock!");
    }
}

main();
```

## 🎯 **Final Thoughts**

Distributed locking **solves concurrency issues** in **distributed systems**, ensuring that only **one node** can access a resource at a time.

**Choosing the right locking method depends on your needs**:

-   **Use Redis (SET NX)** for fast, simple locks.
-   **Use Redlock** for better reliability.
-   **Use MySQL locks** if you already rely on a database.
-   **Use Zookeeper** for **strong consistency** in critical systems.
