# 1. **Replication in RDBMS**

Replication is the process of **copying and distributing data** from one database to another to ensure **high availability, redundancy, and scalability**. It helps databases handle more read operations and provides **fault tolerance** in case of failures.

### **Why Use Replication?**

✅ **High Availability** – Ensures database uptime even if one server fails.  
✅ **Load Balancing** – Distributes read requests across multiple servers.  
✅ **Disaster Recovery** – Provides backup copies in case of failures.  
✅ **Geographical Distribution** – Keeps data closer to users in different locations.

---

## **2. Types of Replication**

### **1. Master-Slave Replication (Primary-Replica Replication)**

✅ **How It Works:**

-   The **Master** (Primary) database handles **both reads and writes**.
-   The **Slave** (Replica) database **only handles read requests**.
-   The Master replicates **all changes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)** to the Slaves.
-   If the Master fails, a **Slave can be promoted** to Master.

✅ **Example Setup:**

```
              +----------------+
              |    Client      |
              +----------------+
                     |
        ---------------------------------
        |                               |
+----------------+              +----------------+
| Master (Primary) | ---> Replicates ---> |  Slave (Replica) |
+----------------+              +----------------+
                                     (Read-Only)
```

✅ **Advantages:**  
✔ Improves **read performance** (reads are offloaded to Slaves).  
✔ Provides **data redundancy** for backup.  
✔ Reduces load on Master.

🚨 **Disadvantages:**  
❌ **Writes are handled by only one server**, which can become a bottleneck.  
❌ **Replication delay** – Slaves might lag behind Master.

✅ **Use Cases:**

-   **Analytics & Reporting** (Running heavy read queries on Slave).
-   **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)** (Distributing read load).

---

### **2. Master-Master Replication (Active-Active Replication)**

✅ **How It Works:**

-   Both databases act as **Masters**, handling **reads and writes**.
-   Changes made on one Master are replicated to the other Master.
-   If one Master fails, the system still **supports writes and reads**.

✅ **Example Setup:**

```
        +--------------------+
        |    Load Balancer   |
        +--------------------+
                 |
        ----------------------
        |                    |
+----------------+   +----------------+
|   Master 1     |<-->|   Master 2     |
|  (Active)      |    |  (Active)      |
+----------------+    +----------------+
         (Both handle reads & writes)
```

✅ **Advantages:**  
✔ **No single point of failure** (Both servers handle writes).  
✔ **Improves performance** (Reads & writes are load-balanced).

🚨 **Disadvantages:**  
❌ **Conflict resolution needed** (e.g., if both Masters update the same record).  
❌ **Increased complexity** (More synchronization required).

✅ **Use Cases:**

-   **Multi-region deployments** (E.g., one database in US, another in Europe).
-   **Applications needing high availability** (e.g., banking systems).

---

## **3. Other Replication Strategies**

### **3.1. Multi-Master Replication (N-Way Replication)**

✅ **How It Works:**

-   Similar to **Master-Master**, but with **more than 2 Masters**.
-   Used in **distributed systems** like cloud databases.

🚨 **Challenges:**  
❌ **Complex conflict resolution** when multiple servers update the same data.  
❌ **Synchronization overhead** when handling multiple writes.

✅ **Example:**  
Google Spanner, Amazon Aurora

---

### **3.2. Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Replication**

| Type             | How It Works                                                                     | Pros                           | Cons                                           |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Synchronous**  | Changes are instantly replicated to the replica before confirming a transaction. | Ensures **strong consistency** | Slower transactions                            |
| **Asynchronous** | Changes are written to Master, then later copied to Slaves.                      | Faster writes                  | Replicas may lag behind (eventual consistency) |

🚀 **Example:**

-   **Synchronous**: Used in **banking** to avoid transaction loss.
-   **Asynchronous**: Used in **content delivery networks (CDNs)** for performance.

---

## **4. How Replication Works in Popular Databases**

### **MySQL Replication**

-   Supports **Master-Slave & Master-Master**.
-   Uses **binary logs** to track changes.
-   Commonly used for **read scaling**.

### **PostgreSQL Replication**

-   Supports **Streaming Replication** (real-time data sync).
-   Uses **logical replication** to allow partial data replication.

### **MongoDB Replication (NoSQL)**

-   Uses **Replica Sets** with automatic failover.
-   Supports **multi-region deployment**.

### **Microsoft SQL Server Replication**

-   Offers **Transactional, Merge, and Snapshot Replication**.

## **5. When to Use Which Replication?**

| Scenario                   | Use Case                         | Best Replication Type       |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Read-heavy workloads**   | Scaling read requests            | **Master-Slave**            |
| **High availability**      | No downtime allowed              | **Master-Master**           |
| **Global applications**    | Databases in different locations | **Multi-Master**            |
| **Financial transactions** | Strong consistency needed        | **Synchronous Replication** |

---

## **6. Conclusion**

-   **Replication ensures high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance.**
-   **Master-Slave** is great for read-heavy applications, but write operations are limited.
-   **Master-Master** provides redundancy and write scalability but requires conflict resolution.
-   **Multi-Master & Global Replication** are useful for worldwide distributed databases.
-   **Choosing synchronous or asynchronous replication depends on consistency vs. performance trade-offs.**

# 2. **Sharding in RDMS**

Sharding is a **database architecture pattern** that involves **splitting** a large database into **smaller, more manageable pieces** called **shards**. Each shard **stores a subset of data** and operates independently.

This approach **improves scalability and performance** by distributing **read and write operations** across multiple databases instead of a single large one.

✅ **Example Use Case:**  
A **user database** for a social media platform might be **sharded** based on user ID ranges, so each shard handles a specific set of users.

---

## **2. Why Use Sharding?**

✅ **Improves Scalability** – The system can handle more users by adding more shards.  
✅ **Reduces Load on a Single Database** – Queries and transactions are spread across multiple databases.  
✅ **Improves Query Performance** – Since each shard has **less data**, queries execute faster.  
✅ **Reduces Index Size** – Smaller indexes result in faster searches.  
✅ **Prevents Bottlenecks** – Unlike replication, writes can scale horizontally.  
✅ **Increases Fault Tolerance** – If one shard fails, only a portion of data is affected.

🚨 **Challenges of Sharding**  
❌ **Increased Complexity** – The application must know how to route queries to the correct shard.  
❌ **Data Distribution Issues** – Uneven data distribution (hotspots) can lead to unbalanced shards.  
❌ **Cross-Shard Queries are Hard** – Queries spanning multiple shards are inefficient.  
❌ **Resharding is Difficult** – Moving data between shards when they grow is complex.

---

## **3. How Sharding Works?**

Sharding splits data horizontally across multiple databases based on a **sharding key** (a field used to determine which shard the data belongs to).

### ✅ **Basic Sharding Example**

| User ID | User Name | Email   |
| ------- | --------- | ------- |
| 1       | Alice     | a@x.com |
| 2       | Bob       | b@x.com |
| 3       | Charlie   | c@x.com |
| 4       | Dave      | d@x.com |
| 5       | Eve       | e@x.com |

👉 **Sharding by User ID Ranges:**

-   **Shard 1** → Stores **Users 1-3**
-   **Shard 2** → Stores **Users 4-5**

Each shard is an **independent database** with its own storage, processing, and query execution.

---

## **4. Types of Sharding Strategies**

### **1. Range-Based Sharding**

-   Data is divided into shards based on a **range of values** in a column (e.g., User ID, Date).
-   Example: Users **1-10K** go to **Shard 1**, **10K-20K** go to **Shard 2**, and so on.

✅ **Pros:**  
✔ Easy to implement  
✔ Queries on a known range are fast

🚨 **Cons:**  
❌ **Data Skew** – Some shards might become overloaded if data isn't evenly distributed  
❌ **Rebalancing is hard** – If one shard is full, shifting data is complex

### **2. Hash-Based Sharding**

-   A **hash function** is applied to a field (e.g., User ID) to determine the shard.
-   Example: `Shard = hash(UserID) % NumberOfShards`

✅ **Pros:**  
✔ Ensures **even distribution of data**  
✔ Avoids hotspots

🚨 **Cons:**  
❌ Hard to **add new shards** (rebalancing required)  
❌ Hard to **run range queries**

### **3. Directory-Based Sharding**

-   Uses a **lookup table** to map each record to its respective shard.

✅ **Pros:**  
✔ Highly flexible – Any sharding logic can be applied  
✔ New shards can be added easily

🚨 **Cons:**  
❌ The lookup table becomes a **single point of failure**  
❌ Increases **query overhead**

---

## **5. Sharding vs. Replication vs. Partitioning**

| Feature               | Sharding                                        | Replication                           | Partitioning                                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Distribution** | Divides data across multiple databases          | Copies data across multiple databases | Stores data in logical partitions within a single database |
| **Scalability**       | Horizontally scalable                           | Improves read scalability, not writes | Improves performance                                       |
| **Fault Tolerance**   | High (if shards are replicated)                 | High                                  | Moderate                                                   |
| **Query Complexity**  | Hard (cross-shard queries are difficult)        | Easy                                  | Moderate                                                   |
| **Example Use Case**  | Large-scale web apps (social media, e-commerce) | High availability (backup servers)    | OLAP systems                                               |

🚀 **Replication is best for availability**, while **sharding is best for scalability**.

---

## **6. How to Implement Sharding?**

### **Step 1: Choose a Sharding Key**

-   Select a field for distributing data across shards (e.g., User ID, Region, Order ID).
-   The **sharding key should evenly distribute data** to avoid hotspots.

### **Step 2: Define a Sharding Strategy**

-   Decide whether to use **Range, Hash, or Directory-based** sharding.
-   Ensure the strategy **minimizes query overhead**.

### **Step 3: Implement a Query Router**

-   The application needs logic to **route queries** to the correct shard.
-   Can be implemented at **app level** or using a **proxy (e.g., MySQL Proxy, MongoDB Router)**.

### **Step 4: Handle Cross-Shard Queries**

-   Use **federated queries** or **aggregate results from multiple shards**.

### **Step 5: Monitor & Optimize**

-   Regularly check **shard sizes** to ensure even distribution.
-   Plan for **resharding** as data grows.

---

## **7. Examples of Sharding in Real-World Databases**

### **1. MySQL Sharding**

-   Uses **proxy-based sharding** or **manual application-level sharding**.
-   Sharding is not built-in, but tools like **Vitess** help.

### **2. PostgreSQL Sharding**

-   Supports **table partitioning**, but true sharding needs tools like **Citus**.

### **3. MongoDB Sharding**

-   Built-in **sharding with MongoDB Cluster**.
-   Uses a **shard key** to distribute documents.

### **4. Cassandra Sharding**

-   Uses a **distributed hash table (DHT)** for automatic sharding.
-   Best for **highly scalable NoSQL applications**.
