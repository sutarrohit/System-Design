# **SQL Databases**

SQL databases are relational databases that store data in structured formats using tables, rows, and columns. They follow a strict schema and use **Structured Query Language (SQL)** for defining and manipulating data. Examples of SQL databases include **MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle DB, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite**.

## **1. Core Features of SQL Databases**

### **1.1 Relational Model**

-   SQL databases are based on the **relational model**, where data is stored in tables (relations).
-   Each table consists of **rows (records/tuples)** and **columns (fields/attributes)**.
-   Relationships between tables are maintained using **primary keys** and **foreign keys**.

### **1.2 Fixed Schema**

-   SQL databases require a **predefined schema**, which means the structure (tables, columns, data types, constraints) must be defined before inserting data.
-   Any changes in the schema require **ALTER TABLE** operations.

### **1.3 ACID Properties**

SQL databases provide **ACID compliance**, ensuring data integrity and reliability in transactions.

-   **Atomicity**: A transaction is **all or nothing**—either all operations succeed, or none take effect.
-   **Consistency**: The database remains in a **valid state** before and after a transaction.
-   **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other, preventing data corruption.
-   **Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, it is permanently stored even if the system crashes.

These properties make SQL databases **ideal for applications requiring strong data integrity**, such as financial systems and e-commerce platforms.

## **2. SQL Query Capabilities**

### **2.1 CRUD Operations**

-   **C**reate: `INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);`
-   **R**ead: `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition;`
-   **U**pdate: `UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1 WHERE condition;`
-   **D**elete: `DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;`

### **2.2 Joins**

SQL supports **JOIN operations**, allowing data retrieval from multiple tables efficiently.

-   **INNER JOIN**: Returns only matching rows between tables.
-   **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
-   **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.
-   **FULL JOIN**: Returns all rows from both tables, with NULLs for non-matching rows.

Example:

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.dept_id = departments.id;
```

### **2.3 Indexing for Performance**

-   Indexes improve search and retrieval speed.
-   Common types: **B-Tree Indexes, Hash Indexes, Full-Text Indexes**.

Example:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON employees(name);
```

### **2.4 Transactions**

-   SQL databases support transactions using `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK`.

Example:

```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE user_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE user_id = 2;
COMMIT;
```

If an error occurs, a `ROLLBACK;` command can be used to undo changes.

## **3. Advantages of SQL Databases**

✅ **Structured & Organized Data**: Suitable for applications needing strict schemas and relationships.  
✅ **Powerful Query Language**: Supports complex queries, aggregations, and joins.  
✅ **Data Integrity & Consistency**: ACID compliance ensures reliable transactions.  
✅ **Security Features**: Supports authentication, authorization, and encryption.  
✅ **Scalability**: Supports **vertical scaling** (adding CPU/RAM) and **replication** for read scalability.

## **4. Disadvantages of SQL Databases**

❌ **Limited Scalability**: Scaling horizontally (adding more servers) is complex compared to NoSQL.  
❌ **Fixed Schema**: Schema modifications require careful planning.  
❌ **Performance Issues with Large Data Sets**: Queries with complex joins can be slow.

## **5. When to Use SQL Databases?**

SQL databases are best suited for:

-   **Banking and Finance**: ACID compliance ensures transaction reliability.
-   **E-commerce and Inventory Management**: Structured product and order data.
-   **Enterprise Applications**: CRM, ERP, and HR systems.
-   **Data Analytics**: SQL queries for aggregations and reporting.

If you need **strong consistency, structured data, and complex queries**, SQL databases are the best choice.
