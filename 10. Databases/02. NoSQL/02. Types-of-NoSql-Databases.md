# 1. **Key-Value Store**

A **Key-Value Store** is a type of **NoSQL database** that stores data as **a collection of key-value pairs**. It is one of the simplest and fastest types of databases, designed for high-speed reads and writes.

Popular **key-value stores** include **Redis, DynamoDB, Riak, and Memcached**.

## **1. Core Concept of Key-Value Stores**

A **key-value store** is like a **dictionary (hash map)** where:

-   Each **key** is unique and acts as an identifier.
-   Each **value** is the data associated with that key.
-   Operations involve simple **get (read), set (write), and delete** functions.

Example:

```bash
SET user:123 "Alice"
GET user:123  # Returns "Alice"
DEL user:123  # Deletes the key-value pair
```

### **1.1 O(1) Reads and Writes**

-   **Constant time (O(1)) lookup**: Since key-value stores are typically implemented using **hash tables** or **tree-based structures**, retrieving a value by key is extremely fast.
-   **Efficient Writes**: Storing a key-value pair is usually just inserting data into memory or an SSD-backed store.

### **1.2 Lexicographic Ordering for Efficient Range Queries**

-   Some key-value stores maintain keys in **sorted order** (lexicographically) using data structures like **B-Trees** or **LSM Trees**.
-   This allows efficient **range queries**, where you can retrieve **keys between a given range**.
-   Example: In **DynamoDB**, sorting by key prefix can help fetch a range of items efficiently.

Example (Fetching users in range "user:100" to "user:200"):

```bash
SCAN user:100 user:200
```

---

## **2. Features of Key-Value Stores**

### **2.1 High Performance & Scalability**

-   **In-Memory Storage**: Many key-value stores like **Redis and Memcached** store data in **RAM**, making reads/writes extremely fast.
-   **Horizontal Scaling**: These databases are easily **distributed** across multiple servers using **sharding** and **replication**.

### **2.2 Simplicity**

-   The key-value model is **easy to understand and use**.
-   There are **no complex joins, schemas, or relationships** like in SQL databases.

### **2.3 Supports Storing Metadata with Values**

-   Some key-value stores allow adding **metadata** (such as time-to-live, versioning, or expiration) along with the value.
-   Example: In Redis, you can set **expiry time (TTL)** for cache keys.

Example (setting a key with an expiration of 60 seconds):

```bash
SET session:123 "active" EX 60
```

### **2.4 Limited Operations & Complexity Shift to Application Layer**

-   Key-value stores only support **basic operations**:
    -   `SET key value`
    -   `GET key`
    -   `DELETE key`
-   If complex queries (e.g., filtering, aggregations, relationships) are needed, they must be handled at the **application layer**.

---

## **3. Use Cases of Key-Value Stores**

### **3.1 Caching Layer (e.g., Redis, Memcached)**

-   **Reduces database load** by storing frequently accessed data in-memory.
-   Example: Store user session data in Redis instead of fetching from a database every time.

```bash
SET session:123 "user_data" EX 300  # Expires in 300 seconds
```

### **3.2 Session Management (e.g., Redis)**

-   Used to **store and retrieve session data** quickly.
-   Common in web applications for **user authentication sessions**.

### **3.3 Real-Time Analytics & Leaderboards (e.g., Redis Sorted Sets)**

-   Used for **storing high-speed data updates** (e.g., live game scores, stock prices).
-   Example: Using Redis Sorted Sets for a **leaderboard**:

```bash
ZADD leaderboard 100 "Alice"
ZADD leaderboard 95 "Bob"
ZRANGE leaderboard 0 -1 WITHSCORES  # Get leaderboard
```

### **3.4 IoT and Sensor Data (e.g., DynamoDB, Redis)**

-   Stores **rapidly changing** sensor readings or IoT device data.
-   Example: Storing temperature sensor readings with timestamps.

```bash
SET temperature:sensor1:timestamp_123 "25°C"
```

### **3.5 Shopping Cart (e.g., DynamoDB, Redis)**

-   Stores shopping cart data for e-commerce platforms.
-   Example:

```bash
HSET cart:123 item1 "Laptop"
HSET cart:123 item2 "Mouse"
```

| **Use Case**          | Caching, Session Data | JSON-like objects         | Big Data, Analytics         |

---

## **5. When to Use a Key-Value Store?**

✅ **If you need high-speed reads/writes (O(1) performance).**  
✅ **If you require an in-memory cache (e.g., Redis, Memcached).**  
✅ **For session management, real-time analytics, and IoT data.**  
✅ **For simple lookups where complex queries are not needed.**

### **When NOT to Use a Key-Value Store?**

❌ If **you need complex queries, filtering, or joins** (Use **Document Stores** like MongoDB).  
❌ If **you need structured data with ACID compliance** (Use **SQL Databases**).  
❌ If **you need analytics on large data sets** (Use **Column Stores** like Cassandra).

---

## **Conclusion**

-   **Key-Value Stores** are **fast, scalable, and ideal for simple key-based lookups**.
-   They are widely used in **caching, real-time data, session storage, and analytics**.
-   However, **they lack advanced querying** and **force developers to handle complex logic in the application layer**.

# 2. **Document Store**

A **Document Store** is a type of **NoSQL database** designed to store, retrieve, and manage semi-structured data in **document format** (typically **JSON, XML, BSON, or other hierarchical formats**).

Popular **Document Stores** include **MongoDB, CouchDB, Firebase Firestore, and Amazon DocumentDB**.

## **1. Core Concept of Document Stores**

A **document store** treats data as **documents**, where:

-   Each document represents an **object or entity** (e.g., a user, product, or order).
-   Documents are stored in **collections** (analogous to tables in SQL but without a fixed schema).
-   Unlike relational databases, documents **do not require a predefined structure**—each document can have a different set of fields.

### **Example of a Document (JSON format in MongoDB)**

```json
{
    "_id": "12345",
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 28,
    "email": "alice@example.com",
    "address": {
        "street": "123 Main St",
        "city": "New York",
        "zipcode": "10001"
    },
    "hobbies": ["reading", "traveling"]
}
```

This document represents a **user** object with nested structures.

---

## **2. Key Features of Document Stores**

### **2.1 Schema Flexibility**

-   Unlike SQL databases, **documents in the same collection can have different structures**.
-   Example: A **users** collection can store different documents with different fields.

```json
// User 1
{
  "_id": "123",
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com"
}

// User 2
{
  "_id": "124",
  "name": "Bob",
  "phone": "+1234567890",
  "age": 30
}
```

### **2.2 Querying Based on Document Structure**

-   Document stores provide APIs or a query language to query data based on **fields inside the document**.
-   Example: **MongoDB Query Language (MQL)** to find a user by email:

```bash
db.users.find({ "email": "alice@example.com" })
```

-   Queries can filter based on **nested fields, arrays, or ranges**.

### **2.3 Nested Data and Relationships**

-   Documents can have **embedded/nested objects** instead of using **joins** like SQL databases.
-   Example: A **blog post with comments embedded** inside the document.

```json
{
    "title": "Understanding NoSQL",
    "author": "John Doe",
    "comments": [
        { "user": "Alice", "comment": "Great post!" },
        { "user": "Bob", "comment": "Very informative." }
    ]
}
```

-   This avoids **expensive JOIN operations** required in relational databases.

### **2.4 Indexing and Performance**

-   Document databases **support indexing** for faster retrieval.
-   Example: In MongoDB, you can create an **index on the email field**:

```bash
db.users.createIndex({ "email": 1 })
```

-   This speeds up queries searching by email.

### **2.5 Scalability and Distribution**

-   **Horizontally scalable** by **sharding data across multiple servers**.
-   Example: MongoDB uses **sharded clusters** to distribute data efficiently.

---

## **3. How Documents Are Organized?**

Documents can be organized in different ways depending on the **database implementation**:

| **Method**      | **Description**                                                 |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Collections** | Group related documents (e.g., "users", "orders").              |
| **Tags**        | Metadata-based organization (used in CouchDB).                  |
| **Metadata**    | Extra fields for categorization (e.g., timestamps, versioning). |
| **Directories** | Hierarchical storage (e.g., Firebase Firestore).                |

---

## **4. Document Stores vs. Other NoSQL Databases**

| Feature                | Document Stores (MongoDB)  | Key-Value Stores (Redis)  | Column Stores (Cassandra)  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Data Model**         | JSON-like documents        | Key-Value Pairs           | Wide-column tables         |
| **Schema Flexibility** | ✅ Flexible                | ✅ Flexible               | ✅ Flexible                |
| **Query Capabilities** | ✅ Advanced Queries        | ❌ Limited to key lookups | ✅ Optimized for analytics |
| **Best For**           | Semi-structured data, APIs | Caching, fast lookups     | Big Data, time-series data |

---

## **5. Use Cases of Document Stores**

✅ **Content Management Systems (CMS)**

-   Example: Storing blog posts, articles, and product descriptions.
-   Each document represents an article with different metadata.

✅ **E-commerce & Catalogs**

-   Example: Storing product details, reviews, and pricing.
-   Products may have different attributes, making schema-less design useful.

✅ **User Profiles & Personalization**

-   Store **user preferences, settings, and activity logs**.
-   Example:

```json
{
    "user_id": "123",
    "name": "Alice",
    "preferences": {
        "theme": "dark",
        "notifications": true
    }
}
```

✅ **Mobile & Web Applications (Firebase Firestore)**

-   Example: **Real-time chat applications** store messages in Firestore.

✅ **Logging & Analytics**

-   Example: Storing **log files, event tracking data**, or **clickstream data** for analytics.

✅ **Internet of Things (IoT) Data**

-   Example: **Sensor readings** stored as JSON documents.

---

## **6. When to Use a Document Store?**

✅ **When data is semi-structured and may change over time.**  
✅ **If relationships can be handled within the document itself.**  
✅ **For applications requiring fast queries and high scalability.**  
✅ **When complex filtering, indexing, or full-text search is needed.**

### **When NOT to Use a Document Store?**

❌ If **data is highly relational and requires complex joins** (Use **SQL databases**).  
❌ If **you only need key-value lookups** (Use **Redis or DynamoDB**).  
❌ If **you need structured columnar storage for analytics** (Use **Cassandra or BigTable**).

---

## **Conclusion**

-   **Document Stores** are highly **flexible, scalable, and ideal for applications handling semi-structured data**.
-   They provide **powerful query capabilities, nested documents, and indexing**, making them **suitable for modern web applications, e-commerce, CMS, and mobile apps**.
-   However, they are **not ideal for complex transactions requiring strict ACID compliance**.

# 3. **Wide Column Store**

A **Wide Column Store** (also called a Column-Family Database) is a type of **NoSQL database** optimized for **big data workloads and analytics**. Unlike relational databases that store data in **rows**, wide column stores organize data in **columns**, allowing efficient queries on large datasets.

Popular **Wide Column Stores** include:

-   **Google Bigtable** (pioneered the concept)
-   **Apache HBase** (used with Hadoop)
-   **Apache Cassandra** (high scalability)
-   **ScyllaDB** (Cassandra-compatible, optimized for performance)

## **1. Core Concept of Wide Column Stores**

In a **Wide Column Store**, data is stored in a **flexible, column-oriented format**.

-   The basic unit is a **column** (**name/value pair**).
-   **Columns are grouped into "Column Families"** (analogous to tables in SQL).
-   A **row key uniquely identifies a row**, and each row can have **different sets of columns**.
-   **Super column families** further group column families for hierarchical structuring.
-   Each value has a **timestamp**, allowing for **versioning and conflict resolution**.

### **Example of Wide Column Store Structure (Cassandra Model)**

```
Row Key: User123
--------------------------------------------------------------
| Name     | Email             | Phone    | Address          |
--------------------------------------------------------------
| "Alice"  | "alice@email.com" | "123456" | "NY, USA"        |
--------------------------------------------------------------
```

Each **row key** (User123) identifies a **row**, and the data is stored **by columns**, not rows.

---

## **2. How Wide Column Stores Work?**

### **2.1 Column-Based Storage**

Instead of storing **data in rows (like SQL databases)**, wide column stores store data **in columns**.  
This makes **queries for specific columns much faster** because unnecessary columns are ignored.

### **2.2 Column Families & Rows**

-   **Column Families**: Collections of related columns (like a table but without a fixed schema).
-   **Rows**: Identified by a **row key**, containing multiple **columns**.
-   **Columns**: Each column contains a **name, value, and timestamp**.

Example in **Apache Cassandra**:

```
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    email TEXT,
    phone TEXT
);
```

Here, `users` is a **column family**, and each row has a unique **row key (id)**.

---

## **3. Structure of a Wide Column Store**

| **Component**     | **Description**                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Row Key**       | Uniquely identifies a row.                 |
| **Column**        | Stores a name-value pair with a timestamp. |
| **Column Family** | Groups related columns together.           |
| **Super Column**  | Groups multiple column families.           |

### **Example Data Representation in Wide Column Store**

```
Row Key: User123
-----------------------------------------------------------
| Personal_Info                | Contact_Details          |
-----------------------------------------------------------
| Name: Alice                   | Email: alice@mail.com   |
| Age: 30                       | Phone: 1234567890       |
-----------------------------------------------------------
```

-   The **row key** is `User123`.
-   **Columns are grouped into families** (e.g., Personal_Info and Contact_Details).
-   Each column has a **timestamp** for version control.

---

## **4. Key Features of Wide Column Stores**

### ✅ **Schema Flexibility**

-   Different rows can have **different sets of columns**.
-   No need to define all columns upfront.

Example:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (id, name, email) VALUES (1, 'Alice', 'alice@example.com');
INSERT INTO users (id, name, phone) VALUES (2, 'Bob', '9876543210');
```

Here, **Alice has an email but no phone**, while **Bob has a phone but no email**.

---

### ✅ **Efficient Querying (Column-Based Reads)**

-   **Only necessary columns are read** (unlike SQL databases that read entire rows).
-   **Column-based compression** reduces storage and speeds up queries.

Example Query in **Cassandra CQL**:

```sql
SELECT name, email FROM users WHERE id = 'User123';
```

-   This fetches **only required columns** instead of reading the whole row.

---

### ✅ **Scalability (Horizontal Scaling)**

-   Data is **partitioned across multiple nodes** (sharding).
-   Supports **high write throughput**.

Example: **Apache Cassandra** uses **consistent hashing** for **automatic load balancing** across nodes.

---

### ✅ **Built-in Replication & High Availability**

-   Wide column stores support **automatic data replication** across multiple servers.
-   Example: **Cassandra uses a peer-to-peer replication model**, ensuring **no single point of failure**.

---

### ✅ **Timestamps & Versioning**

-   Each value has a **timestamp** to track multiple versions of a column.
-   Used for **conflict resolution** in distributed systems.

Example:

| Row Key | Name  | Age | Timestamp  |
| ------- | ----- | --- | ---------- |
| User123 | Alice | 30  | 1700000000 |
| User123 | Alice | 31  | 1700005000 |

Here, the **most recent timestamp (31 years old)** is used.

---

## **5. Wide Column Stores vs. Other NoSQL Databases**

| Feature                | Wide Column Stores (Cassandra) | Document Stores (MongoDB) | Key-Value Stores (Redis) |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Data Model**         | Column Families & Rows         | JSON Documents            | Key-Value Pairs          |
| **Schema Flexibility** | ✅ Flexible                    | ✅ Flexible               | ✅ Flexible              |
| **Query Capabilities** | ✅ Efficient Reads/Writes      | ✅ Complex Queries        | ❌ Only Key Lookups      |
| **Best For**           | Big Data, Time-Series Data     | Web Apps, APIs            | Caching, Sessions        |

---

## **6. Use Cases of Wide Column Stores**

✅ **Big Data & Analytics**

-   Example: **Google Bigtable** powers Google Search Index.

✅ **Time-Series Data (IoT, Logs, Metrics)**

-   Example: Storing **sensor readings** for real-time analytics.

✅ **Recommendation Engines**

-   Example: **Netflix & Facebook** use Cassandra for personalized recommendations.

✅ **Fraud Detection & Finance**

-   Example: **Bank transactions & risk analysis** require efficient column-based queries.

✅ **Social Media & Messaging Apps**

-   Example: **Instagram & Twitter use Cassandra** for storing user feeds.

---

## **7. When to Use a Wide Column Store?**

✅ **When handling massive datasets with high write throughput**.  
✅ **When queries require selecting only specific columns, not full rows**.  
✅ **For applications that need high scalability and availability**.  
✅ **For distributed, fault-tolerant systems** (e.g., global-scale applications).

### **When NOT to Use a Wide Column Store?**

❌ If data is **highly relational** with many **complex joins** (Use **SQL databases**).  
❌ If you need **real-time document-based queries** (Use **MongoDB**).  
❌ If **simple key-value lookups** are enough (Use **Redis**).

---

## **8. Conclusion**

-   **Wide Column Stores** are ideal for **big data workloads, high-speed writes, and distributed systems**.
-   They use a **column-oriented structure**, making **queries faster and more efficient**.
-   Used by **Google, Facebook, Netflix, and Twitter** to handle large-scale, high-performance workloads.
-   **Cassandra, HBase, and Bigtable** are leading implementations.

# 4. **Graph Databases**

A **Graph Database** is a type of **NoSQL database** designed to handle data with complex relationships. Unlike **relational databases (SQL)** that store data in **tables with rows and columns**, graph databases store data in **nodes** (entities) and **edges** (relationships between entities).

### **Key Components of a Graph Database**

1. **Nodes**: Represent **entities** (e.g., a person, product, city).
2. **Edges (Relationships)**: Represent **connections between nodes** (e.g., "FRIEND_OF", "PURCHASED", "LOCATED_IN").
3. **Properties**: Additional **metadata** stored in nodes and edges (e.g., age, name, weight).
4. **Labels**: Used to **categorize nodes** (e.g., "User", "Product").

### **Example of a Graph Structure (Social Network)**

```
(Alice) --[FRIEND_OF]--> (Bob)
(Alice) --[LIKES]--> (Movie: Inception)
(Bob) --[WORKS_AT]--> (Company: Google)
```

-   **Nodes**: Alice, Bob, Inception, Google
-   **Edges (Relationships)**: FRIEND_OF, LIKES, WORKS_AT
-   **Properties**: (Alice: age = 30), (Movie: release_year = 2010)

### **Graph vs. Relational Database**

| Feature           | Graph Database (Neo4j)           | Relational Database (MySQL)          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Data Storage**  | Nodes & Edges                    | Tables & Rows                        |
| **Relationships** | Stored directly                  | Foreign keys & joins                 |
| **Performance**   | Fast for connected data          | Slow joins for complex relationships |
| **Use Case**      | Social networks, fraud detection | Banking, e-commerce                  |

---

## **2. How Graph Databases Work?**

Graph databases use **graph theory** to efficiently **store, retrieve, and analyze relationships** between entities.

### **2.1 Graph Query Language (Cypher - Neo4j)**

Unlike SQL, which uses `SELECT`, graph databases use **pattern-matching queries**.

#### **Example Query: Find Alice’s friends**

```cypher
MATCH (a:Person)-[:FRIEND_OF]->(b:Person)
WHERE a.name = "Alice"
RETURN b;
```

This finds all **people (b)** connected to **Alice (a)** with the **FRIEND_OF** relationship.

---

### **2.2 Index-Free Adjacency**

-   **Relational Databases:** Need **indexes and foreign key joins** to connect data.
-   **Graph Databases:** Store relationships **directly inside the database**, allowing **fast traversal** between nodes.

---

## **3. Types of Graphs in Graph Databases**

1. **Property Graph Model (Used in Neo4j, ArangoDB, JanusGraph)**

    - Nodes and edges have **properties (key-value pairs)**.
    - Example: `(Alice {age: 30}) --[FRIEND_OF {since: 2015}]--> (Bob)`.

2. **RDF (Resource Description Framework) Model (Used in AllegroGraph, Apache Jena)**
    - Based on **triples (subject, predicate, object)**.
    - Example: `(Alice, FRIEND_OF, Bob)`.

---

## **4. Features of Graph Databases**

✅ **Fast Relationship Queries**

-   Complex **many-to-many** relationships are handled efficiently.

✅ **Schema Flexibility**

-   No fixed schema; relationships and properties can evolve dynamically.

✅ **Graph Algorithms for Insights**

-   Supports **PageRank, community detection, shortest path algorithms**, etc.

✅ **High Performance for Relationship-Heavy Data**

-   No costly **JOIN operations** like SQL databases.

---

## **5. Use Cases of Graph Databases**

✅ **Social Networks (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter)**

-   Represent **friend connections, followers, likes, shares**.
-   Example: **Find mutual friends** between two users.

✅ **Fraud Detection (Banks, Insurance, Cybersecurity)**

-   Detects **anomalous transaction patterns**.
-   Example: **Identify linked accounts involved in money laundering**.

✅ **Recommendation Systems (Netflix, Amazon, Spotify)**

-   Suggests products, movies, or music based on relationships.
-   Example: "People who liked this also liked that".

✅ **Knowledge Graphs (Google Knowledge Graph, Wikipedia)**

-   Connects concepts (e.g., “Elon Musk” → “Tesla” → “Electric Vehicles”).

✅ **Supply Chain Management (Logistics, Manufacturing)**

-   Models **supplier-product relationships** for optimization.

---

## **6. Popular Graph Databases**

| Graph Database     | Features                                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **JanusGraph**     | Scalable, distributed graph database                          |
| **TigerGraph**     | High-speed analytics for real-time graph queries              |

---

## **7. When to Use a Graph Database?**

✅ If data **has complex relationships** that need **efficient traversal**.  
✅ If queries involve **shortest paths, recommendations, fraud detection**.  
✅ If dealing with **many-to-many relationships** (e.g., social networks).

### **When NOT to Use a Graph Database?**

❌ If data is **simple, tabular, and structured** (Use **SQL databases**).  
❌ If primary operations are **key-value lookups** (Use **Redis**).

---

## **8. Conclusion**

-   **Graph databases** store data as **nodes and relationships**, making them ideal for **complex, highly-connected data**.
-   They **outperform relational databases** when handling **deep relationships**.
-   Used in **social networks, fraud detection, recommendation systems, knowledge graphs, and supply chain management**.
