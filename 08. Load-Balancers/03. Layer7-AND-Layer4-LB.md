# 1. **Layer 7 Load Balancing**

Layer 7 (Application Layer) load balancers make **intelligent routing decisions** based on the actual **content of the request**, rather than just the source and destination IP addresses.

They **terminate** the client’s request, inspect the application data (HTTP headers, URLs, cookies, etc.), and then **forward the request** to the most appropriate backend server.

## **🔹 How Layer 7 Load Balancing Works?**

1️⃣ **A client sends an HTTP request** (e.g., `GET /videos/intro.mp4`).  
2️⃣ The Layer 7 load balancer **receives the request and examines its content** (headers, URL, cookies).  
3️⃣ Based on predefined rules, it routes the request to the most suitable backend server.  
4️⃣ The server **processes the request** and returns a response.  
5️⃣ The load balancer **forwards the response** back to the client.

📌 **Example:**

-   Requests for `videos/*` → Sent to **video servers**
-   Requests for `billing/*` → Sent to **high-security servers**

## **🔹 Features & Benefits of Layer 7 Load Balancing**

✅ **Content-Based Routing**

-   Directs requests based on URL paths, headers, cookies, or request type.
-   Example: Sending static assets (images, CSS) to a cache server while dynamic requests go to an application server.

✅ **SSL Termination**

-   Offloads **SSL decryption** so backend servers don’t need to handle expensive cryptographic operations.

✅ **Compression & Caching**

-   Can compress responses and cache frequently accessed content, reducing server load.

✅ **Request Manipulation**

-   Can **rewrite headers** (e.g., adding security headers) or modify responses before forwarding them to the client.

✅ **Better Security**

-   Can block malicious requests (e.g., **SQL injection, XSS**).
-   Protects backend servers from **DDoS attacks** by filtering suspicious traffic.

## **🔹 Layer 7 Load Balancer Example Use Cases**

📌 **Video Streaming Platforms**

-   Route `/videos/*` requests to servers optimized for media streaming.

📌 **E-commerce Websites**

-   Send checkout requests (`/checkout/*`) to a **PCI DSS-compliant** secure server.

📌 **Microservices Architecture**

-   Route `api.example.com/orders/*` to the **Orders Service**, while `api.example.com/users/*` goes to the **User Service**.

📌 **Multi-Tenant Applications**

-   Load balancer can examine a custom **"tenant" HTTP header** to direct traffic to the correct customer’s server.

## **🔹 Layer 7 vs. Layer 4 Load Balancing**

| Feature                | **Layer 7 Load Balancing**                 | **Layer 4 Load Balancing**                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Routing Decision**   | Based on HTTP headers, cookies, URL        | Based on IP address & port                  |
| **Flexibility**        | High (intelligent traffic routing)         | Low (simple round-robin, least connections) |
| **Performance Impact** | Slightly higher (due to packet inspection) | Lower (only looks at network-level data)    |
| **Common Protocols**   | HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, gRPC               | TCP, UDP                                    |
| **Security Features**  | WAF, SSL termination, request filtering    | Basic DDoS protection, firewall rules       |

# 2. **Layer 4 Load Balancing**

Layer 4 load balancers operate at the **transport layer** of the OSI model. They use **IP addresses and TCP/UDP ports** to distribute incoming requests across multiple backend servers.

Unlike Layer 7 load balancers, **Layer 4 does not inspect the request content** (e.g., HTTP headers or cookies). Instead, it performs **Network Address Translation (NAT)** to forward packets between clients and backend servers.

## **🔹 How Layer 4 Load Balancing Works?**

1️⃣ A client sends a request to a server's IP and port (e.g., `TCP:80` or `UDP:53`).  
2️⃣ The Layer 4 load balancer intercepts the request and checks the **source and destination IP/port**.  
3️⃣ Based on predefined **load balancing rules**, it selects an available backend server.  
4️⃣ It forwards the request to the chosen server using **NAT** (modifying the destination IP).  
5️⃣ The server processes the request and responds to the client **via the load balancer**.

📌 **Example:**  
A website receives **millions of concurrent TCP connections**. A Layer 4 load balancer distributes these connections to multiple backend servers **without looking at the HTTP headers or URL paths**.

## **🔹 Features & Benefits of Layer 4 Load Balancing**

✅ **Fast & Efficient**

-   Minimal processing overhead since it only looks at IPs & ports.
-   Works well for high-throughput applications like VoIP, gaming, and video streaming.

✅ **Protocol-Agnostic**

-   Supports **TCP, UDP, FTP, DNS, and more**.
-   Unlike Layer 7, it doesn’t care about application-layer details.

✅ **Supports Any Application**

-   Can be used for **HTTPS, SMTP, SSH, WebSockets, etc.** without modifying the request.

✅ **Scales Well for High Traffic**

-   Ideal for **DDoS mitigation** and handling large volumes of network traffic.

✅ **SSL Passthrough**

-   It can forward **encrypted traffic (HTTPS, TLS)** directly to backend servers **without decryption**, reducing computational load.

## **🔹 Layer 4 Load Balancer Example Use Cases**

📌 **Cloud Infrastructure**

-   AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure use Layer 4 load balancing to distribute network traffic across data centers.

📌 **Gaming Servers & VoIP Applications**

-   Distributes UDP traffic efficiently for real-time applications like **video conferencing and multiplayer games**.

📌 **DNS & SMTP Load Balancing**

-   Handles **DNS (UDP:53) and email (SMTP:25) requests** without inspecting payloads.

📌 **DDoS Protection**

-   Can filter out **malicious traffic** by limiting the number of connections per client IP.
