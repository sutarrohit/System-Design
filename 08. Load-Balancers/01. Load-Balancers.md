# **Load Balancers**

A **Load Balancer** is a system component that **distributes incoming client requests across multiple servers** (application servers, databases, or other resources) to ensure no single server is overwhelmed. It helps achieve **high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability** in distributed systems.

‚úÖ **Key Roles of Load Balancers:**

-   Prevents **overloading** of individual servers.
-   Ensures **even distribution** of traffic.
-   Automatically **redirects traffic** away from unhealthy servers.
-   Improves **performance and reliability**.
-   Eliminates **single points of failure**.

## **Why Do We Need Load Balancers?**

Without load balancers, systems face the following problems:  
‚ùå Single points of failure (if one server goes down, the system becomes unavailable).  
‚ùå Overloaded servers during peak traffic hours.  
‚ùå Uneven distribution of requests across servers.  
‚ùå Poor response times and user experience.

---

## **How Does a Load Balancer Work?**

### **Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Client Request:**

    - A user sends a request to a web application.
    - The request reaches the **Load Balancer** instead of going directly to the server.

2. **Health Check:**

    - The Load Balancer checks which backend servers are **healthy** and available.

3. **Distribute Request:**

    - The Load Balancer **forwards the request** to one of the available servers based on a **load balancing algorithm**.

4. **Server Response:**

    - The selected server processes the request and returns the response to the Load Balancer.

5. **Return to Client:**
    - The Load Balancer sends the response back to the **client**.

---

## **Load Balancing Algorithms**

Load balancers use different algorithms to decide which server should handle each request.

### ‚úÖ Common Algorithms:

| Algorithm            | Description                                                    | Use Case                        |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Round Robin          | Distributes requests evenly across servers                     | Simple workloads                |
| Least Connections    | Sends traffic to the server with **fewest active connections** | Applications with long sessions |
| Weighted Round Robin | Distributes requests based on **server capacity (weight)**     | Mixed server capacities         |
| IP Hash              | Routes requests from the same client IP to the **same server** | Session persistence             |
| Random               | Selects servers **randomly**                                   | Simple, low-load applications   |

-   Automatically scales with demand.

üìå **Examples:**

-   **AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**
-   **Google Cloud Load Balancer**
-   **Azure Load Balancer**

---

## **Load Balancer Features**

### üîë **1. Health Checks**

Periodically checks if backend servers are **healthy**.  
If a server is down, the Load Balancer automatically **removes it** from the pool.

---

### üîë **2. SSL Termination**

The Load Balancer handles **SSL decryption** of incoming HTTPS requests.  
‚úÖ Improves performance by **offloading encryption work** from backend servers.

---

### üîë **3. Sticky Sessions (Session Persistence)**

Ensures that requests from the **same user** are always routed to the **same server**.  
Useful for applications that rely on **in-memory sessions**.

---

### üîë **4. Failover and High Availability**

Automatically redirects traffic to **healthy servers** in case of failures.

---

## **Load Balancer Architecture**

There are two common deployment architectures:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Single Load Balancer Architecture**

-   Simple and easy to set up.
-   However, the **Load Balancer itself becomes a single point of failure**.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Multiple Load Balancers (High Availability)**

-   Two or more Load Balancers run in **active-active** or **active-passive** mode.
-   A third system (like a DNS or health check service) manages failover between Load Balancers.

---

## **Example Architecture with Load Balancer**

```
Client ---> Load Balancer ---> App Server 1
                       ---> App Server 2
                       ---> App Server 3
```

‚úÖ If **App Server 1** goes down, requests automatically shift to **App Server 2** and **App Server 3**.

---

## **Load Balancer in Microservices Architecture**

Load balancers are widely used in **microservices-based systems** to distribute API traffic across different services.

üìå Example Setup:

```
Client ---> API Gateway ---> Load Balancer ---> Microservice A
                                 ---> Microservice B
                                 ---> Microservice C
```

# 2. **Load Balancer vs Reverse Proxy**

Both **Load Balancers** and **Reverse Proxies** play crucial roles in modern web architecture. They improve performance, security, and reliability, but they serve **different purposes**. Let‚Äôs break them down in detail.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ What is a Load Balancer?**

A **Load Balancer** distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend servers to ensure no single server is overloaded. It **optimizes performance, ensures high availability, and prevents failures**.

‚úÖ **Key Features of Load Balancers:**

-   Distributes traffic **evenly** across multiple servers.
-   **Prevents overloading** of any single server.
-   Performs **health checks** and routes traffic only to healthy servers.
-   Eliminates **single points of failure**.
-   Supports **horizontal scaling** (adding more servers when traffic increases).

üìå **Example Use Case:**

-   A website with **multiple servers** behind a Load Balancer.
-   If **one server crashes**, the Load Balancer redirects traffic to the **remaining healthy servers**.

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ What is a Reverse Proxy?**

A **Reverse Proxy** sits in front of a web server and **forwards client requests** to the backend server. Unlike a Load Balancer, it is not necessarily used for distributing traffic but for **security, caching, and SSL termination**.

‚úÖ **Key Features of Reverse Proxy:**

-   Protects backend servers by **hiding their IP addresses**.
-   Acts as a **security layer** (can filter requests, prevent attacks).
-   Caches responses for **faster performance**.
-   Handles **SSL termination** (decrypts SSL traffic before sending it to the server).
-   Can compress responses to **reduce bandwidth usage**.

üìå **Example Use Case:**

-   A single web server is protected by an **NGINX Reverse Proxy**, which handles **SSL decryption, caching, and security**.

| **How It Works**             | Spreads requests across multiple backend servers                 | Acts as an intermediary between client & server     |
| **Performance Optimization** | Reduces server load by balancing traffic                         | Caches responses to reduce request load             |
| **Security Benefits**        | Prevents overloading & ensures failover                          | Hides backend servers & filters malicious traffic   |
| **Health Checks**            | Monitors server health & reroutes traffic                        | Doesn't monitor backend health (unless configured)  |
| **Caching**                  | Does not cache responses                                         | Can cache responses to serve static content faster  |
| **Session Handling**         | Sticky sessions can be enabled to route users to the same server | Can store sessions and forward requests accordingly |

üìå **Analogy:**

-   A **Load Balancer** is like a traffic cop directing cars (requests) to different lanes (servers).
-   A **Reverse Proxy** is like a security checkpoint, filtering and optimizing requests before allowing them to pass through.
