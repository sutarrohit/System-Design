# **Load Balancers**

A **Load Balancer** is a system component that **distributes incoming client requests across multiple servers** (application servers, databases, or other resources) to ensure no single server is overwhelmed. It helps achieve **high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability** in distributed systems.

✅ **Key Roles of Load Balancers:**

-   Prevents **overloading** of individual servers.
-   Ensures **even distribution** of traffic.
-   Automatically **redirects traffic** away from unhealthy servers.
-   Improves **performance and reliability**.
-   Eliminates **single points of failure**.

## **Why Do We Need Load Balancers?**

Without load balancers, systems face the following problems:  
❌ Single points of failure (if one server goes down, the system becomes unavailable).  
❌ Overloaded servers during peak traffic hours.  
❌ Uneven distribution of requests across servers.  
❌ Poor response times and user experience.

---

## **How Does a Load Balancer Work?**

### **Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Client Request:**

    - A user sends a request to a web application.
    - The request reaches the **Load Balancer** instead of going directly to the server.

2. **Health Check:**

    - The Load Balancer checks which backend servers are **healthy** and available.

3. **Distribute Request:**

    - The Load Balancer **forwards the request** to one of the available servers based on a **load balancing algorithm**.

4. **Server Response:**

    - The selected server processes the request and returns the response to the Load Balancer.

5. **Return to Client:**
    - The Load Balancer sends the response back to the **client**.

---

## **Load Balancing Algorithms**

Load balancers use different algorithms to decide which server should handle each request.

### ✅ Common Algorithms:

| Algorithm            | Description                                                    | Use Case                        |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Round Robin          | Distributes requests evenly across servers                     | Simple workloads                |
| Least Connections    | Sends traffic to the server with **fewest active connections** | Applications with long sessions |
| Weighted Round Robin | Distributes requests based on **server capacity (weight)**     | Mixed server capacities         |
| IP Hash              | Routes requests from the same client IP to the **same server** | Session persistence             |
| Random               | Selects servers **randomly**                                   | Simple, low-load applications   |

---

## **Load Balancer Features**

### 🔑 **1. Health Checks**

Periodically checks if backend servers are **healthy**.  
If a server is down, the Load Balancer automatically **removes it** from the pool.

---

### 🔑 **2. SSL Termination**

The Load Balancer handles **SSL decryption** of incoming HTTPS requests.  
✅ Improves performance by **offloading encryption work** from backend servers.

---

### 🔑 **3. Sticky Sessions (Session Persistence)**

Ensures that requests from the **same user** are always routed to the **same server**.  
Useful for applications that rely on **in-memory sessions**.

---

### 🔑 **4. Failover and High Availability**

Automatically redirects traffic to **healthy servers** in case of failures.

---

## **Load Balancer Architecture**

There are two common deployment architectures:

### **1️⃣ Single Load Balancer Architecture**

-   Simple and easy to set up.
-   However, the **Load Balancer itself becomes a single point of failure**.

---

### **2️⃣ Multiple Load Balancers (High Availability)**

-   Two or more Load Balancers run in **active-active** or **active-passive** mode.
-   A third system (like a DNS or health check service) manages failover between Load Balancers.

---

## **Example Architecture with Load Balancer**

```
Client ---> Load Balancer ---> App Server 1
                       ---> App Server 2
                       ---> App Server 3
```

✅ If **App Server 1** goes down, requests automatically shift to **App Server 2** and **App Server 3**.

---

## **Load Balancer in Microservices Architecture**

Load balancers are widely used in **microservices-based systems** to distribute API traffic across different services.

📌 Example Setup:

```
Client ---> API Gateway ---> Load Balancer ---> Microservice A
                                 ---> Microservice B
                                 ---> Microservice C
```

---

# 2. **Load Balancer vs Reverse Proxy**

Both **Load Balancers** and **Reverse Proxies** play crucial roles in modern web architecture. They improve performance, security, and reliability, but they serve **different purposes**. Let’s break them down in detail.

## **1️⃣ What is a Load Balancer?**

A **Load Balancer** distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend servers to ensure no single server is overloaded. It **optimizes performance, ensures high availability, and prevents failures**.

✅ **Key Features of Load Balancers:**

-   Distributes traffic **evenly** across multiple servers.
-   **Prevents overloading** of any single server.
-   Performs **health checks** and routes traffic only to healthy servers.
-   Eliminates **single points of failure**.
-   Supports **horizontal scaling** (adding more servers when traffic increases).

📌 **Example Use Case:**

-   A website with **multiple servers** behind a Load Balancer.
-   If **one server crashes**, the Load Balancer redirects traffic to the **remaining healthy servers**.

---

## **2️⃣ What is a Reverse Proxy?**

A **Reverse Proxy** sits in front of a web server and **forwards client requests** to the backend server. Unlike a Load Balancer, it is not necessarily used for distributing traffic but for **security, caching, and SSL termination**.

✅ **Key Features of Reverse Proxy:**

-   Protects backend servers by **hiding their IP addresses**.
-   Acts as a **security layer** (can filter requests, prevent attacks).
-   Caches responses for **faster performance**.
-   Handles **SSL termination** (decrypts SSL traffic before sending it to the server).
-   Can compress responses to **reduce bandwidth usage**.

📌 **Example Use Case:**

-   A single web server is protected by an **NGINX Reverse Proxy**, which handles **SSL decryption, caching, and security**.
