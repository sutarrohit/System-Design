# API Gateway: A Complete Guide

APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, are a set of rules and protocols that allow two software applications or services to communicate with each other.

As applications grow in size, the number of APIs increases too. Without the right tools and infrastructure, managing these APIs can quickly become a challenge.

This is where **API Gateway** comes into play.

An **API Gateway** acts as a central server that sits between clients (e.g., browsers, mobile apps) and backend services.

Instead of clients interacting with multiple microservices directly, they send their requests to the API Gateway. The gateway processes these requests, enforces security, and forwards them to the appropriate microservices.

In this article, we will explore:

-   **Why do we need an API Gateway?**
-   **Core features of an API Gateway.**
-   **How does an API Gateway work step-by-step?**

## 1. Why Do We Need an API Gateway?

Modern applications, especially those built using **microservices architecture**, have multiple backend services managing different functionalities.

### Example: E-commerce Service

| Service           | Functionality             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| User Service      | Manages user accounts     |
| Payment Service   | Handles payments          |
| Inventory Service | Manages product inventory |

### **Without an API Gateway**

-   Clients would need to know the location and details of all backend services.
-   Developers would need to manage **authentication, rate limiting, and security** for each service individually.

### **With an API Gateway**

-   Clients send all requests to **one place** - the API Gateway.
-   The **API Gateway** takes care of:
    -   **Routing** requests.
    -   **Authentication** and **security**.
    -   **Load balancing**.

---

## 2. Core Features of an API Gateway

### 1. Authentication and Authorization

The **API Gateway** secures backend systems by ensuring that only authorized users and clients can access the services.

It handles tasks like:

-   **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of the client using **tokens (JWT, OAuth)**, API keys, or certificates.
-   **Authorization**: Ensuring the client has permission to access the specific resource.

This eliminates the need for **each microservice** to handle authentication.

---

### 2. Rate Limiting

Rate limiting controls the number of requests a client can make within a given time frame to:

-   Prevent abuse.
-   Protect backend services from **DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service)** attacks.

**Example:**

-   A public API might allow only **100 requests per minute per user**.

If the limit is exceeded, the API Gateway responds with:

```http
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
```

---

### 3. Load Balancing

High-traffic applications need to distribute incoming requests across multiple service instances.

The API Gateway can:

-   **Distribute traffic** using algorithms like **Round Robin, Least Connections, or IP Hash**.
-   **Redirect traffic** to healthy services.

---

### 4. Caching

To reduce response times and minimize the load on backend services, the API Gateway can cache frequently requested data.

Example:

-   Product catalogs.
-   Static resources like images or metadata.

Caching improves performance and reduces operational costs.

---

### 5. Request Transformation

Different microservices may require different **request formats**.

The API Gateway can:

-   **Convert requests** from JSON to XML or vice versa.
-   Modify the request body or headers as needed.

---

### 6. Service Discovery

In dynamic environments like Kubernetes, services can scale up or down. The API Gateway uses **service discovery** to identify healthy instances.

-   It automatically discovers the latest IP addresses of services.
-   Ensures high availability.

---

### 7. Circuit Breaking

Circuit breaking prevents requests from being sent to **failing services**. When a service consistently fails, the API Gateway temporarily stops sending requests to it.

-   Prevents cascading failures.
-   Improves system resilience.

---

### 8. Logging and Monitoring

The API Gateway logs detailed information about each request:

-   **Request Source.**
-   **Response Time.**
-   **Status Code.**

This helps in:

-   Monitoring performance.
-   Troubleshooting issues.

---

## 3. How Does an API Gateway Work?

### Example: Food Delivery App

Suppose you're using a **food delivery app** to order dinner. Here’s what happens step-by-step:

### **Step 1: Request Reception**

The app sends a request to the API Gateway:

```json
{
    "userId": "123",
    "restaurantId": "456",
    "items": ["Pizza", "Coke"],
    "address": "123 Street, City"
}
```

The API Gateway acts as a **single entry point**.

---

### **Step 2: Request Validation**

The Gateway validates the request format and headers.

Example Code:

```js
app.post("/api/v1/orders", async (req, res) => {
    if (!req.headers["content-type"].includes("application/json")) {
        return res.status(400).send("Invalid content type");
    }
    // Continue processing
});
```

---

### **Step 3: Authentication & Authorization**

The API Gateway verifies the user's identity using JWT tokens:

```js
const token = req.headers.authorization.split(" ")[1];
const user = await verifyToken(token);

if (!user.permissions.includes("place_orders")) {
    res.status(403).send("Forbidden");
}
```

---

### **Step 4: Rate Limiting**

The API Gateway ensures the user doesn’t exceed their request limit:

```js
const key = `rate_limit:order:${userId}`;
const current = await redis.incr(key);

if (current > 10) {
    res.status(429).send("Too Many Requests");
}
```

---

### **Step 5: Request Transformation**

If the Delivery Service needs GPS coordinates, the API Gateway transforms the request:

```js
const coordinates = await getCoordinatesFromAddress(address);

const newRequest = {
    deliveryLocation: {
        lat: coordinates.lat,
        lng: coordinates.lng
    }
};
```

---

### **Step 6: Request Routing**

The API Gateway routes the request to the appropriate microservice.

Example:

```js
axios.post("http://order-service/api/orders", newRequest);
```

---

### **Step 7: Response Handling**

The API Gateway transforms the response before sending it to the client.

```js
const transformedResponse = {
    orderId: response.order_reference,
    estimatedDelivery: response.eta
};
res.send(transformedResponse);
```

---

### **Step 8: Logging & Monitoring**

Finally, the API Gateway logs every request:

```js
await logger.log({
    timestamp: new Date(),
    path: req.path,
    method: req.method,
    status: res.statusCode
});
```

---

## ✅ Conclusion

An **API Gateway** plays a critical role in modern microservices architecture by:

-   Simplifying client-server interactions.
-   Enhancing security, load balancing, and request transformation.
-   Improving system resilience with circuit breaking and rate limiting.
